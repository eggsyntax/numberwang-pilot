Notes on changes:
- After the first run (12/20/24), discovered that I'd failed to add the 2nd and 3rd examples to the final two rules. Added those, reran, and edited in the new results (interestingly, this led to *worse* results on the final rule).
- 01/01/24: Added o1-preview and o1-mini (in a separate branch) & ran them -- had to edit the prompt, because asking o1 models to 'think out loud' causes OpenAI to reject the request.
- 01/01/24: Discovered that I had been inconsistent on the collatzish rule -- I had changed from 3n+1 to 5n+1 but one of the examples hadn't been properly updated. Reran; o1-preview and o1-mini succeeded; all others failed.
