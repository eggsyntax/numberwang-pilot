Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Try to make your hypotheses more elegant & simple.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[2, 5, 7, 14]

I notice that the differences between consecutive numbers are 3, 2, and 7, which don't form a simple pattern. However, I also observe that each number is a prime number or a number that is close to a prime number. My initial hypothesis is that the list consists of numbers that are either prime or have a small difference with a prime number.",

I consider the possibility that the rule is simply that the list consists of prime numbers in increasing order. This would be a simpler and more elegant explanation than my current hypothesis. However, I should also consider the original list [2, 5, 7, 14], where 14 is not a prime number. This could be an outlier, or it could indicate that the rule is more complex.

{
  "thought_process": "Given that all the test cases I've designed so far have been confirmed to satisfy the rule, and considering the consistent pattern of prime numbers in increasing order, I am inclined to believe that the rule is indeed related to prime numbers. However, the original list [2, 5, 7, 14] still presents an anomaly with the number 14, which is not prime. To reconcile this, I could consider that the rule might allow for a specific pattern or sequence that includes prime numbers but also permits certain non-prime numbers under specific conditions. Yet, all my tests so far have only confirmed lists of prime numbers. It's possible that the original list was an outlier or an error, or there's a more complex rule at play that I haven't fully grasped.

This contradicts my current hypothesis that the list consists entirely of prime numbers in increasing order. Given this new information, I must reconsider my hypothesis. It seems that the presence of non-prime numbers does not necessarily violate the rule, as previously thought. This suggests that the rule might be more about the sequence or pattern of numbers rather than their primality.

One possibility is that the rule is related to the differences between consecutive numbers or another numerical property that is not directly related to primality.",

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. List items must be in strictly increasing order
2. The list consists of numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference between consecutive terms.



{'explanation': "These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 requires each number to be larger than the previous one, but doesn't specify by how much. Rule 2 requires the difference between consecutive terms to be constant. For example, [1,2,4] would satisfy Rule 1 (strictly increasing) but not Rule 2 (not a constant difference). Conversely, [-2,0,2,4] would satisfy Rule 2 (constant difference of 2) but any arithmetic sequence with a constant difference would satisfy Rule 2, even if the difference is negative, which would violate Rule 1's requirement of strictly increasing order.", 'judgment': False}
