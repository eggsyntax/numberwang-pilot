Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[22, 15, 6, 9]

Numbers aren't in ascending or descending order\n3. No obvious mathematical sequence (not arithmetic or geometric)\n4. Numbers are all less than 25\n5. Mix of one and two digit numbers\n\nI'll start with a simple hypothesis and try to test it systematically. One possibility is that each number in the list must be less than 25. Let me test this with various combinations, including some edge cases.",

Requesting final judgment.
{'explanation': "These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 only requires that no numbers in the list are prime, while Rule 2 requires the numbers to be orderable in a strictly monotonic sequence. For example, the list [4, 6, 6] would be valid under Rule 1 (no primes) but invalid under Rule 2 (can't have repeats). Conversely, [4, 5, 6] would be valid under Rule 2 but invalid under Rule 1 (5 is prime). The rules have fundamentally different requirements and will produce different results for many inputs.", 'judgment': False}


Rule was: No members of the list are prime numbers.
Did model succeed? False
Model took 5 turns.
