Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Try to make your hypotheses more elegant & simple.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

The fact that all test cases were positive suggests that the rule might be simpler than initially thought, possibly related to the alternating pattern of increases and decreases.

One potential refinement is to consider the magnitude of changes or the specific sequence of operations (e.g., add, then subtract, then add, etc.).",

  "thought_process": "With all test cases again being confirmed, it suggests that the alternating increase and decrease pattern is a strong component of the rule. However, the rule might be even simpler, such as a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms alternates in sign. This would mean that after an increase, there's a decrease, and vice versa, without necessarily specifying the exact amounts of increase or decrease. To further refine this, I should test cases that push the boundaries of this hypothesis, such as sequences with larger or smaller changes, or sequences where the pattern of increases and decreases is more pronounced.",

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. There are no repeated numbers in the list.
2. The list consists of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms alternates in sign and is non-zero, meaning an increase is always followed by a decrease, and a decrease is always followed by an increase, with no consecutive terms being equal.



{'explanation': "These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 only requires that no number appears more than once in the list. Rule 2 is much more restrictive, requiring alternating increases and decreases between consecutive terms. For example, the list [1, 2, 3, 4] would satisfy Rule 1 (no repeats) but would violate Rule 2 (no alternating increases/decreases). Conversely, any list that satisfies Rule 2 must also satisfy Rule 1 (since consecutive terms cannot be equal and the alternating pattern prevents any later repetition), but many lists that satisfy Rule 1 won't satisfy Rule 2.", 'judgment': False}


Rule was: There are no repeated numbers in the list.
Did model succeed? False
