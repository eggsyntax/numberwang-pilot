Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Try to make your hypotheses more elegant & simple.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[4, 7, 6, 3]



Response {
  "thought_process": "Let me analyze this initial list carefully. Looking at [4,7,6,3], I notice a few potential patterns to investigate: 1) The numbers are all single digits, 2) There's a mix of odd and even numbers, 3) The sequence goes up then down. I should test various aspects to narrow down what's significant.",

Response {

Response {

Response {
  "thought_process": "Perfect! All five test cases were accepted. This strongly supports my current hypothesis.

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
}

Here are the two rules:
1. Sum of all items is 20
2. A valid list must contain exactly 4 numbers that satisfy two conditions: 1) the product of the first two numbers must be greater than or equal to the product of the last two numbers, AND 2) the sum of all four numbers must be greater than or equal to 20



{'judgment': False, 'explanation': "These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 simply requires the sum of all list items to be exactly 20, with no restrictions on the number of items or their relationships. Rule 2 is much more restrictive, requiring exactly 4 numbers where the first two numbers' product is greater than or equal to the last two numbers' product, and their total sum is at least 20. For example, a list of [10, 10] would satisfy Rule 1 but not Rule 2, while Rule 2 requires a specific structure that Rule 1 does not. The conditions on product and number of items in Rule 2 make it fundamentally different from the simple sum requirement of Rule 1."}


Rule was: Sum of all items is 20
Did model succeed? False
Model took 9 turns.
