Rule: List items must be in strictly increasing order

Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[2, 5, 7, 14]

  "thought_process": "The given list [2, 5, 7, 14] seems to have a pattern where each number is increasing, but not in a straightforward arithmetic sequence. I notice that the differences between consecutive numbers are 3, 2, and 7, which don't form a simple pattern. However, looking at the numbers themselves, I can observe that they might be related to powers of 2 or another base, but with an adjustment. One possible pattern could be that each number is one more than a power of 2 (2^1 - 1 + 2 = 3 doesn't fit, but 2^1 + 1 = 3 is close, and 2^2 + 1 = 5 fits, 2^3 - 1 = 7 fits if considering a subtraction, and 2^3 + 6 = 14 also fits if considering an addition). However, this observation doesn't hold consistently. Another hypothesis is that the sequence consists of numbers that are either prime or have a specific relationship to prime numbers. Given the numbers 2 (prime), 5 (prime), 7 (prime), and 14 (not prime but 2 * 7), a possible rule could involve prime numbers or their products.",

{
  "thought_process": "Given that all the test cases I provided were accepted, it seems my initial hypothesis about the sequence consisting of prime numbers or products of distinct prime numbers in ascending order has some merit. However, the acceptance of [2, 4, 6, 8] suggests that the rule might not strictly involve prime numbers or their products, since 4, 6, and 8 are not prime. This leads me to consider a broader hypothesis that could encompass these results. One possibility is that the sequence consists of numbers that are in ascending order and have a specific property, such as being composite or prime, but the key factor seems to be the ascending order and perhaps a relationship to a basic mathematical operation or property. Another consideration is that the sequences might simply be increasing sequences of numbers that fit a certain criteria, such as all being even, all being odd, or all being prime, but the mix of accepted sequences suggests it's more about the nature of the numbers themselves rather than their primality or compositeness alone.",

At this point, it seems unlikely that there's a more specific property or pattern that the sequences must follow beyond being increasing. This hypothesis is simple, elegant, and explains all the data provided so far. It's also worth noting that this hypothesis is very broad and would encompass a vast number of possible sequences, which aligns with the fact that all provided test cases have been accepted.",

The common factor among these rejected sequences is that they either contain duplicate elements ([1, 1, 2, 3], [5, 5, 5, 6], [3, 3, 4, 5], and [1, 2, 2, 4]) or are not strictly increasing ([2, 4, 6, 5]). This suggests that the rule for the sequence might be more specific than just 'any increasing sequence of integers.' It seems that the sequence must be strictly increasing, with no duplicates allowed. This refinement aligns with the initial hypothesis but adds a crucial detail about the nature of the increase and the uniqueness of elements.",

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. List items must be in strictly increasing order
2. The sequence consists of a strictly increasing sequence of integers, with no duplicates.



{'explanation': "Both rules express the same core requirement: each number must be strictly greater than all previous numbers in the list. Rule 1 uses 'strictly increasing order' while Rule 2 breaks this down into 'strictly increasing sequence' plus 'no duplicates', but these are logically equivalent. The 'no duplicates' in Rule 2 is actually redundant since a strictly increasing sequence cannot contain duplicates by definition. Both rules would handle edge cases (like empty lists or single-element lists) the same way.", 'judgment': True}


Rule was: List items must be in strictly increasing order
Did model succeed? True
