Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[2, 5, 8, 11]



Turn number 1
Alright, let's begin by analyzing the given list: [2, 5, 8, 11]. 

### Step 1: Observations
1. The numbers are increasing.
2. The difference between consecutive numbers is constant: 5 - 2 = 3, 8 - 5 = 3, 11 - 8 = 3.
3. The list appears to be an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.
4. All numbers are integers, and there are no negative numbers or decimals.

### Step 2: Initial Hypotheses
Based on the observations, I will brainstorm six possible hypotheses:
1. The list is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.
2. The list is any arithmetic sequence (common difference can vary).
3. The list contains integers that are all congruent to 2 modulo 3 (e.g., 2, 5, 8, 11 all satisfy n % 3 = 2).
4. The list contains integers that increase by odd numbers (e.g., +3, +5, etc.).
5. The list contains integers greater than 1.
6. The list contains integers that are not divisible by 3.

### Step 3: Testing Hypotheses
To distinguish between these hypotheses, I will generate five test cases. These cases will include:
- Lists that follow the arithmetic sequence with a difference of 3.
- Lists that follow other arithmetic sequences.
- Lists that test modular arithmetic properties.
- Lists that test whether the numbers must increase by odd numbers.
- Lists that test whether the numbers must be greater than 1 or not divisible by 3.
