Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[14, 7, 9, 14]

{
  "thought_process": "The given list is [14, 7, 9, 14]. At first glance, the list contains integers, and the first and last elements are the same (14). This could suggest a rule involving symmetry or repetition. Alternatively, there might be a mathematical relationship between the numbers, such as differences, sums, or divisors. Another possibility is that the list satisfies a property related to the individual numbers, such as being even, odd, or prime. To start, I will hypothesize that the rule involves the first and last elements being equal, as this is a simple and noticeable pattern. I will test this hypothesis with lists that both satisfy and violate this condition to see if it holds.",

{
  "thought_process": "All the test cases satisfied the rule, and they all have the first and last elements equal. This strongly supports the hypothesis that the first and last elements being equal is a necessary and sufficient condition for the rule. The middle elements appear to have no additional constraints, as they varied widely across the test cases without affecting the outcome. To confirm this, I will test lists with the first and last elements not equal to ensure they do not satisfy the rule, and I will also test lists with equal first and last elements but unusual middle elements to verify that the middle elements truly do not matter.",

Additionally, the middle elements in lists 3, 4, and 5 varied significantly, including negative numbers and zeros, which further supports the idea that the middle elements do not matter. I am now confident that the rule is simply that the first and last elements of the list must be equal, with no constraints on the middle elements.",

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. The first item is duplicated somewhere in the list (eg [17, 4, 8, 17])
2. The first and last elements of the list must be equal.



{'explanation': 'These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 requires the first element to appear at least twice anywhere in the list, while Rule 2 specifically requires the first and last elements to be equal. Consider the list [3, 3, 4]: this satisfies Rule 1 (3 appears twice) but not Rule 2 (first and last elements are different). Conversely, consider [3, 4, 3]: this satisfies Rule 2 (first and last are both 3) but not Rule 1 (the first element only appears once at the start and once at the end, not duplicated elsewhere).', 'judgment': False}


Rule was: The first item is duplicated somewhere in the list (eg [17, 4, 8, 17])
Did model succeed? False
Model took 3 turns.
