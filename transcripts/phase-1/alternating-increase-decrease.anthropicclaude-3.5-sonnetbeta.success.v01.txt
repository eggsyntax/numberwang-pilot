Rule: Differences between successive members of the list are alternately positive and negative (so for example [6, 3, 5, 3, 17, 2, 8, 5] would match the rule).

Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include at least six hypothesis in each "thought_process" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:

}
Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  Differences between successive members of the list are alternately positive and negative (so for example [6, 3, 5, 3, 17, 2, 8, 5] would match the rule).
Model rule: The list must form a zigzag pattern where each number alternates between being greater than and less than its adjacent numbers (i.e., if a number is greater than its predecessor, it must be greater than its successor, and if it's less than its predecessor, it must be less than its successor)
{'explanation': "These rules are describing the exact same pattern. In rule 1, having alternating positive and negative differences between successive elements means that if we move from left to right: if one element increases to the next (positive difference), it must then decrease (negative difference), and vice versa. In rule 2, the zigzag pattern where each number alternates between being greater/less than its neighbors describes the same relationship - if a number is greater than its predecessor, it must be less than its successor (creating the same alternating pattern). Both rules would accept the same lists, like the example [6, 3, 5, 3, 17, 2, 8, 5], and reject the same lists that don't follow this alternating pattern.", 'judgment': True}


Rule was: Differences between successive members of the list are alternately positive and negative (so for example [6, 3, 5, 3, 17, 2, 8, 5] would match the rule).
Did model succeed? True
