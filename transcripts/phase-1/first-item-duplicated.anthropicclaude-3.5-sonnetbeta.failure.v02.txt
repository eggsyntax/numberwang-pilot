Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[14, 7, 9, 14]

  "thought_process": "Let me analyze this initial list carefully. I notice: 1) It contains 4 numbers 2) There's a repeated number (14) 3) Numbers are all positive integers 4) Numbers are relatively small (<15) 5) Numbers aren't strictly increasing/decreasing. Let me test some basic hypotheses: Could it be about having a repeat? About sum properties? About factors? About sequence length? I'll start with varied test cases to explore different possibilities.",

{

This strongly supports my hypothesis about requiring repeats, but I should test some variations to ensure I understand all constraints.

All test cases were valid, which tells me several important things: 1) The list doesn't need to be exactly 4 numbers long 2) Negative numbers are allowed 3) The size of the numbers doesn't matter. The only common factor across all valid lists so far is that they contain at least one repeated number.

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. The first item is duplicated somewhere in the list (eg [17, 4, 8, 17])
2. A list is valid if and only if it contains at least one integer that appears more than once in the list



{'explanation': "Both rules describe lists that contain at least one duplicate number. Rule 1 specifically requires the first number to be duplicated, while Rule 2 allows any number in the list to be duplicated. Rule 2 is more general than Rule 1. For example, [4, 8, 4, 17] would be valid under Rule 2 but not Rule 1, since 4 is duplicated but isn't the first number. Therefore, these rules are not equivalent.", 'judgment': False}


Rule was: The first item is duplicated somewhere in the list (eg [17, 4, 8, 17])
Did model succeed? False
Model took 3 turns.
