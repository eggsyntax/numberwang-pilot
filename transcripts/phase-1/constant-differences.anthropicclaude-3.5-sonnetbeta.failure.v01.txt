Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[2, 5, 8, 11]

Let me think about this systematically.

Initial observations:
1. These are all positive integers
2. Looking at consecutive differences: 5-2=3, 8-5=3, 11-8=3
3. This suggests an arithmetic sequence with common difference 3
4. Starting at 2 and incrementing by 3

Let me generate test cases that will help validate or invalidate this hypothesis, while also considering other possibilities:

1. A similar arithmetic sequence starting at a different number
2. A longer sequence following the same pattern
3. A sequence with negative numbers
4. A sequence with larger gaps
5. A sequence with smaller gaps

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "The most obvious pattern is an arithmetic sequence with difference 3. However, there could be other rules like 'numbers that give remainder 2 when divided by 3' or 'numbers whose digits sum to a particular value'. I'll test various possibilities to narrow it down.",
  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "Arithmetic sequence with common difference 3",
    "Numbers that give remainder 2 when divided by 3",
    "Numbers whose digits sum to a value less than 9",
    "Numbers that are 3 less than a multiple of 3",
    "Numbers that can be expressed as 2 + 3k where k is a non-negative integer",
    "Numbers whose square roots differ by approximately 0.5"
  ],
  "leading_hypothesis": "The list contains numbers in an arithmetic sequence with common difference 3, starting from any positive integer",
  "test_cases": [
    [3, 6, 9, 12],
    [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17],
    [-4, -1, 2, 5],
    [10, 13, 16, 19],
    [1, 4, 7, 10]

Interesting! All test cases were successful. This strongly supports my leading hypothesis about arithmetic sequences with difference 3, but I should still try to falsify it or find if there are additional constraints.

Let me try some more challenging test cases:
1. A very large gap in the sequence to see if continuity matters
2. Just two numbers with difference 3
3. A sequence with a huge starting number
4. A sequence with difference 3 but skipping some terms
5. A single number (to test if minimum length matters)

Aha! This is a very revealing set of results. Let me analyze what we learned:

1. [5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 47] was rejected - so we can't have "jumps" in the sequence
2. [100, 103] was accepted - so just two numbers with difference 3 works
3. [1000000, 1000003, 1000006] was accepted - so size of numbers doesn't matter
4. [2, 5, 11, 14] was rejected - confirming we can't skip numbers
5. [7] was accepted - surprisingly, a single number is valid!

This significantly changes our understanding! Let me revise my hypothesis and test more specifically:

1. Test consecutive terms with difference 3
2. Test if we can have difference -3
3. Test if we can mix positive and negative numbers more
4. Test if we can have zero
5. Test if we can have decimal numbers

{
  "thought_process": "The previous results show that: 1) Single numbers are valid, 2) Pairs with difference 3 are valid, 3) Longer sequences must have consecutive terms (no jumps), 4) Size of numbers doesn't matter.

Very interesting! This gives us crucial new information:

1. [4, 7, 10, 13] - confirms standard ascending sequence works
2. [10, 7, 4] - shows we can go in descending order! (difference of -3 is valid)
3. [-5, -2, 1, 4, 7] - confirms negative numbers work fine
4. [0, 3, 6] - confirms zero is valid
5. [2.5, 5.5, 8.5] - reveals that only integers are allowed!

Let me do one final round of testing to verify my refined hypothesis:

1. Test a very long descending sequence
2. Test mixing ascending and descending (which should fail)
3. Test non-integer whole numbers
4. Test if we can have repeated numbers
5. Test if we can have a single non-integer number

Perfect! These results confirm my understanding completely. Let me summarize what we know with absolute certainty:

1. The list must contain only integers (no decimals, even if they look like integers)
2. A single integer is always valid
3. For multiple numbers:
   - Each consecutive difference must be exactly +3 or exactly -3
   - The direction (ascending or descending) must be consistent throughout the sequence
   - No "zigzagging" allowed
4. There's no restriction on:
   - The size of numbers
   - Whether numbers are positive or negative
   - The length of the sequence (as long as it's at least 1)
   - Using the same number multiple times

I'm now completely confident in my final hypothesis!

{
  "thought_process": "All our tests have consistently supported the same hypothesis, and we've thoroughly tested edge cases and potential variations. We've confirmed the necessity of integers, the validity of single numbers, the requirement for consistent ±3 differences, and the impossibility of mixing directions or using non-integers.",

Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  The difference between successive list items must be constant.
Model rule: A list that contains either: (1) a single integer, or (2) multiple integers where each number differs from the previous by exactly +3 or exactly -3 (maintaining the same direction throughout the sequence)
{'explanation': "Rule 2 is more restrictive than Rule 1. Rule 1 allows for any constant difference between successive items (like +2, +5, -1, etc.), while Rule 2 only allows for differences of exactly +3 or -3. For example, the list [1,3,5,7] would be valid under Rule 1 (constant difference of +2) but invalid under Rule 2 (difference isn't ±3). Therefore, while both rules describe arithmetic sequences, Rule 2 specifies a particular step size that Rule 1 doesn't require.", 'judgment': False}


Rule was: The difference between successive list items must be constant.
