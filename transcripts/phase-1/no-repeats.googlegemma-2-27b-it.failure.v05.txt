Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[4, 11, 8, 6, 17]
[153, 2, 19, 4]
[99, 90, 56]

Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  There are no repeated numbers in the list.
Model rule: The sum of the digits of each number in the list is a prime number.
{'explanation': 'These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 checks for duplicates in the list, while Rule 2 examines the sum of digits in each number. For example, the list [12, 21, 3] would satisfy Rule 2 (since 1+2=3, 2+1=3, and 3 are all prime) but would violate Rule 1 (since 12 and 21 have the same digits). Conversely, [1, 2, 3, 4] would satisfy Rule 1 (no repeats) but not Rule 2 (4 is not prime). These rules are testing completely different properties of the numbers in the list.', 'judgment': False}


Rule was: There are no repeated numbers in the list.
