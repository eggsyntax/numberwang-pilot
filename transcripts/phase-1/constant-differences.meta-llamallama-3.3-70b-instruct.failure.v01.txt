Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[2, 5, 8, 11]

This suggests a simple arithmetic progression. However, it's also possible that the list satisfies other rules, such as being a list of prime numbers, a list of numbers that satisfy a certain modular equation, or a list of numbers that have a specific property. I should consider multiple hypotheses and design tests to distinguish between them.",

Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  The difference between successive list items must be constant.
Model rule: The list consists of numbers in an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3.
{'explanation': 'These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 only requires that the difference between successive items be constant, but allows any constant difference (it could be 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). Rule 2 specifically requires the difference to be exactly 3. For example, the list [1,2,3,4] would satisfy Rule 1 (constant difference of 1) but would not satisfy Rule 2 (which requires difference of 3).', 'judgment': False}


Rule was: The difference between successive list items must be constant.
Did model succeed? False
