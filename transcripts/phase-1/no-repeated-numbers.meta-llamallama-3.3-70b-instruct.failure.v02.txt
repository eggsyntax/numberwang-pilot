Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Try to make your hypotheses more elegant & simple.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

The fact that all lists were accepted suggests that the rule might be simpler or more general than initially thought. I need to consider what common characteristic or pattern these lists share. One possibility is that the lists are accepted based on a property that is not directly related to the specific numbers themselves but rather to how the numbers are arranged or how they change from one to the next. Another approach could be to look for a pattern in the differences or ratios between consecutive numbers, although the initial hypothesis did not specify this clearly. I should also consider the possibility that the rule is based on a more abstract property, such as the list containing an increasing or decreasing sequence, or perhaps a mix of both, but in a specific arrangement.",

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. There are no repeated numbers in the list.
2. The list is accepted if it has exactly 4 elements and contains at least two distinct integers.



{'explanation': 'These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 requires that all numbers in a list be unique (no repeats), while Rule 2 has two different requirements: (a) the list must have exactly 4 elements, and (b) it needs only 2 distinct integers. Under Rule 2, a list like [1,1,2,2] would be accepted because it has 4 elements and 2 distinct integers, but this list would be rejected by Rule 1 because it contains repeated numbers. Additionally, Rule 1 would accept lists of any length (including [1,2,3] or [1,2,3,4,5]) as long as there are no repeats, while Rule 2 strictly requires exactly 4 elements.', 'judgment': False}


Rule was: There are no repeated numbers in the list.
Did model succeed? False
