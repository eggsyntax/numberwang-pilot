Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[2, 5, 8, 11]

  "thought_process": "The given list [2, 5, 8, 11] appears to have a consistent difference between consecutive elements, which is 3. This suggests a linear or arithmetic sequence. I will consider the possibility of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference. Other hypotheses could involve geometric sequences, but the consistent difference here points more strongly towards an arithmetic sequence. To test this hypothesis, I will generate lists that follow or deviate from this pattern.",

{

The inclusion of sequences with negative common differences, a common difference of 0, and sequences starting with negative numbers or zero, suggests that the rule is indeed very general, applying to any arithmetic sequence regardless of its starting point or common difference. At this point, it seems unlikely that there are many, if any, arithmetic sequences that would not satisfy the rule.

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. The difference between successive list items must be constant.
2. The list consists of an arithmetic sequence with any common difference, including positive, negative, or zero differences, and applies to sequences of any length.



{'explanation': 'These rules are describing exactly the same mathematical property. Rule 1 states that the difference between successive items must be constant, which is the definition of an arithmetic sequence. Rule 2 explicitly states this is an arithmetic sequence and clarifies that the common difference can be positive, negative, or zero, and the sequence can be any length. While Rule 2 is more detailed in its specification, both rules describe sequences where each term differs from the previous term by a constant value.', 'judgment': True}


Rule was: The difference between successive list items must be constant.
Did model succeed? True
