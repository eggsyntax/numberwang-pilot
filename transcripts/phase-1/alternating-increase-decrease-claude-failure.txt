Initial prompt: %s

Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[22, 17, 19, 9, 12]

 Let's solve this step by step:

1. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   Differences: 1, 1, 1, 1
   These differences are all positive, so they do not alternate between positive and negative.
   Result: No

2. [24, 23, 22, 21, 20]
   Differences: -1, -1, -1, -1
   These differences are all negative, so they do not alternate between positive and negative.
   Result: No

3. [15, 10, 5, 20, 25]
   Differences: -5, -5, +15, +5
   These differences alternate between negative and positive.
   Result: Yes

4. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
   Differences: 1, 1, 1, 1
   These differences are all positive, so they do not alternate between positive and negative.
   Result: No

5. [-1, 5, 10, 15, 20]
   Differences: 6, 5, 5, 5
   These differences are all positive, so they do not alternate between positive and negative.
   Result: No

Final judgment prompt: %s

Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
}

Here are the two rules:
1. Differences between successive members of the list are alternately positive and negative (so for example [6, 3, 5, 3, 17, 2, 8, 5] would match the rule).
2. The list must contain 5 numbers where the differences between consecutive numbers strictly alternate between negative and positive values, starting with a negative difference. In other words, when looking at the differences between consecutive numbers, the first difference must be negative, the second positive, the third negative, and the fourth positive.


{'judgment': False, 'explanation': 'These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 requires alternating differences throughout the entire list, with no restriction on list length. Rule 2 specifically requires a 5-number list with a precise pattern of differences (negative, positive, negative, positive). A list like [6, 3, 5, 3, 17] would satisfy Rule 2, but a longer list with the same initial pattern would not. Conversely, a longer list with consistent alternating differences would satisfy Rule 1 but not Rule 2. The length requirement and the specific starting condition in Rule 2 make it more restrictive than Rule 1.'}


Rule was: %s Differences between successive members of the list are alternately positive and negative (so for example [6, 3, 5, 3, 17, 2, 8, 5] would match the rule).
