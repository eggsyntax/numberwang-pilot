Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Try to make your hypotheses more elegant & simple.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

  "thought_process": "With all test cases again being confirmed, the hypothesis that the list starts and ends with the same number, and the numbers in between form either an increasing or a decreasing sequence with a common difference, seems robust. However, the case of [7, 7, 7, 7, 7] suggests that the sequence in between doesn't necessarily have to increase or decrease; it can also remain constant. This broadens the hypothesis slightly. To further test the limits of this hypothesis, it might be useful to try sequences where the middle numbers don't follow a simple arithmetic progression, or where the first and last numbers are not identical but still follow a pattern.",

{
  "thought_process": "Given that all test cases have been confirmed, it appears that the hypothesis is quite broad and encompasses a wide range of sequences. The fact that all tested sequences, regardless of their pattern (increasing, decreasing, constant, or none), have been confirmed suggests that the only strict requirement is that the sequence starts and ends with the same number.

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. The first item is duplicated somewhere in the list (eg [17, 4, 8, 17])
2. A sequence satisfies the rule if and only if it starts and ends with the same number, regardless of the pattern or values of the numbers in between.



{'explanation': "These rules are equivalent. In both cases, the first item appears again later in the list. Rule 1 directly states this, while Rule 2 effectively requires the first item to be repeated at the end of the list. The key characteristic is that the first element must reappear, which is precisely what both rules describe. The mechanisms are slightly different (one talks about 'duplication', the other about 'starts and ends'), but the fundamental list property they detect is identical.", 'judgment': True}


Rule was: The first item is duplicated somewhere in the list (eg [17, 4, 8, 17])
Did model succeed? True
