Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[4, 11, 8, 6]

Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  There are no repeated numbers in the list.
Model rule: The list is generated by adding 7 to the previous number, starting with an arbitrary first number.
{'explanation': 'These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 simply requires that each number appears at most once in the list. Rule 2 generates an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 7, meaning each number is 7 more than the previous one. While Rule 2 will always produce a list with no repeats (satisfying Rule 1), Rule 1 allows many sequences that Rule 2 cannot generate. For example, [1, 3, 5] has no repeats but cannot be generated by adding 7 each time. Rule 2 would only allow sequences like [1, 8, 15] or [3, 10, 17].', 'judgment': False}


Rule was: There are no repeated numbers in the list.
Did model succeed? False
Model took 2 turns.
