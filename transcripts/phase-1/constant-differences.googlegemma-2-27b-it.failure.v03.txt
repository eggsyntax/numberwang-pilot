Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[2, 5, 8, 11]

Okay, I'm ready to start investigating the rule behind this list: [2, 5, 8, 11].

**Initial Thoughts:**

* The numbers are increasing.
* The differences between consecutive numbers are constant (3).

**Possible Hypotheses:**

1. The list consists of consecutive multiples of 3, starting with 2.
2. The list consists of numbers generated by adding 3 to the previous number, starting with 2.
3. The list consists of all prime numbers greater than 1.
4. The list consists of numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 3.
5. The list consists of the first four numbers in a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
6. The list consists of numbers that can be expressed as 3n + 2, where n is a non-negative integer.

**Leading Hypothesis:**

The list consists of numbers generated by adding 3 to the previous number, starting with 2.

**Test Cases:**

1. [2, 5, 8, 11, 14]
2. [5, 8, 11, 14, 17]
3. [1, 4, 7, 10, 13]
4. [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
5. [0, 3, 6, 9, 12]

Excellent! All the test cases fit the pattern. This strengthens my confidence in the leading hypothesis.

**Thought Process:**

The fact that all test cases, including those starting with different numbers and using a constant increment, fit the pattern strongly suggests that the rule is indeed based on adding a constant value to the previous number.

**Possible Hypotheses:**

1. The list consists of numbers generated by adding a constant value to the previous number.
2. The list consists of numbers generated by adding 3 to the previous number.
3. The list consists of numbers generated by adding a constant value to the previous number, starting with a specific number.
4. The list consists of consecutive multiples of 3.
5. The list consists of numbers that can be expressed as 3n + k, where n is a non-negative integer and k is a constant.
6. The list consists of numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 3.

**Leading Hypothesis:**

The list consists of numbers generated by adding a constant value to the previous number.

**Test Cases:**

1. [10, 13, 16, 19, 22]
2. [7, 10, 13, 16, 19]
3. [-2, 1, 4, 7, 10]

Interesting! Test case 5 failed, indicating that the increment doesn't have to be constant. Let's refine the hypothesis.

**Thought Process:**

The failure of test case 5 suggests that the rule might involve a pattern in the increments themselves, rather than a constant increment.

**Possible Hypotheses:**

1. The list consists of numbers generated by adding a sequence of numbers to the previous number.
2. The list consists of numbers generated by adding consecutive integers to the previous number.
3. The list consists of numbers generated by adding a specific sequence of numbers to the previous number, repeating the sequence if necessary.
4. The list consists of numbers generated by a quadratic formula.
5. The list consists of numbers generated by a combination of addition and multiplication.
6. The list consists of numbers generated by a Fibonacci-like sequence.

**Leading Hypothesis:**

The list consists of numbers generated by adding consecutive integers to the previous number.

Okay, it seems like adding consecutive integers isn't the right pattern either. Let's rethink our approach.

**Thought Process:**

The fact that none of the test cases worked suggests that the rule might be more complex than simple arithmetic progressions. Perhaps there's a pattern involving squares, cubes, or other mathematical functions.

**Possible Hypotheses:**

1. The list consists of numbers generated by a formula involving squares.
2. The list consists of numbers generated by a formula involving cubes.
3. The list consists of numbers generated by a formula involving both addition and squares.
4. The list consists of numbers generated by a formula involving factorials.
5. The list consists of numbers generated by a recursive formula.
6. The list consists of numbers that satisfy a specific condition related to their prime factorization.

Okay, it seems like we're still on the right track, but need to refine our approach.

Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  The difference between successive list items must be constant.
Model rule: The list consists of numbers generated by subtracting consecutive squares, starting with 1² - 0².
{'explanation': "Let's analyze this carefully. Rule 2 generates a sequence by subtracting consecutive squares: 1² - 0² = 1, 2² - 1² = 3, 3² - 2² = 5, 4² - 3² = 7, etc. This generates the sequence [1, 3, 5, 7, ...]. The difference between successive terms in this sequence is always 2, making it an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. Rule 1 simply requires a constant difference between successive terms, which is more general - it allows for any constant difference, not just 2. Therefore, Rule 2 describes a specific arithmetic sequence, while Rule 1 describes all arithmetic sequences. Rule 2 is a strict subset of Rule 1.", 'judgment': False}
