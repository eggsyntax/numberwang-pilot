Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

This suggests that divisibility might not be the rule. Another possibility is that the numbers could relate to some property of their digits, such as their sum or product.

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. All list members are one less than a number with an integer square root.
2. The list satisfies the rule if and only if it includes only the numbers 24, 48, 8, and 15, or any subset of these numbers.



{'explanation': "Let's analyze this carefully. Rule 1 requires each number to be one less than a perfect square. For small perfect squares: 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=9, 4²=16, 5²=25, 6²=36, 7²=49, etc. So the allowed numbers would be 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, 35, 48, etc. Looking at Rule 2's allowed numbers (24, 48, 8, 15), we can verify that each of these is indeed one less than a perfect square: 8=9-1 (3²-1), 15=16-1 (4²-1), 24=25-1 (5²-1), 48=49-1 (7²-1). However, Rule 1 allows many additional numbers (like 0, 3, 35) that Rule 2 doesn't permit. Therefore, Rule 2 is strictly more restrictive than Rule 1.", 'judgment': False}


Rule was: All list members are one less than a number with an integer square root.
Did model succeed? False
