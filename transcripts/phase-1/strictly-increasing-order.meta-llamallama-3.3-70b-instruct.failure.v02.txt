Rule: List items must be in strictly increasing order
Model: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct

Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Try to make your hypotheses more elegant & simple.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[2, 5, 7, 14]

{
  "thought_process": "The results of the test cases provide more insight into the rule. The list [2, 2, 3, 5] was not accepted, which suggests that the rule may require all elements to be distinct. The list [5, 3, 7, 11] was also not accepted, indicating that the ascending order is indeed a requirement. The list [2, 3, 4, 7] was accepted, which is interesting because it includes a non-prime number (4), suggesting that the rule might not strictly require all elements to be prime, but rather that the presence of non-prime numbers does not automatically disqualify the list. However, the list [7, 11, 13, 13] was not accepted, reinforcing the idea that distinctness is a requirement. Lastly, the list [3, 5, 7, 9] was accepted, which includes a non-prime number (9), further supporting the notion that the rule allows non-prime numbers as long as the list is in ascending order and all elements are distinct is not the case since 9 is not prime and the previous list with duplicate was not accepted.

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. List items must be in strictly increasing order
2. The list consists of distinct prime numbers in ascending order.



{'explanation': "These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 only requires numbers to be strictly increasing (each number larger than the previous), while Rule 2 has two additional major constraints: the numbers must be prime numbers, and they must be distinct. For example, the list [1, 2, 4] would satisfy Rule 1 but not Rule 2 (since 1 and 4 aren't prime). The distinctness requirement in Rule 2 is actually redundant given the ascending order requirement, but the prime number requirement makes these rules fundamentally different.", 'judgment': False}


Rule was: List items must be in strictly increasing order
Did model succeed? False
