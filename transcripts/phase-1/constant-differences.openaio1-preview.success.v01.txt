Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:

{
  "thought_process": "The given list is [2, 5, 8, 11]. Observing the differences between the numbers: 5 - 2 = 3, 8 - 5 = 3, 11 - 8 = 3. So, it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3. Another observation is that all the numbers are congruent to 2 modulo 3 (since 2 % 3 = 2, 5 % 3 = 2, etc.). Possible hypotheses include the list being any arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3, or the list consisting of numbers that are congruent to 2 modulo 3. To test these hypotheses, I'll create test cases that can confirm or refute them.",

{
  "thought_process": "From the previous test results, all the arithmetic sequences we tested were accepted, even with different common differences. The sequence [2,6,10,14] has a common difference of 4, and it was accepted, which suggests that the common difference doesn't have to be 3. This leads me to think that any arithmetic sequence is accepted. To test this, I'll include both increasing and decreasing arithmetic sequences, as well as sequences that are not arithmetic, to see if they are accepted or rejected.

The sequences that were rejected ([2,4,7,11] and [3,5,8,12]) are not arithmetic sequences because their differences between consecutive terms are not constant. This suggests that the rule is that the list must be an arithmetic sequence of integers. To test this, I'll try sequences that are arithmetic with fractional common differences, sequences with zero common difference (constant sequences), and sequences that are not arithmetic sequences.

Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  The difference between successive list items must be constant.
Model rule: The list is any arithmetic sequence of integers.
{'explanation': 'These rules are exactly equivalent. An arithmetic sequence is defined as a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant, which is precisely what rule 1 states. Both rules describe what is mathematically known as an arithmetic progression with integer terms. The fact that both specify integers and require constant differences between successive terms makes them mathematically identical.', 'judgment': True}


Rule was: The difference between successive list items must be constant.
Did model succeed? True
