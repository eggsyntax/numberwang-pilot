Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box!
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Try to make your hypotheses more elegant & simple.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task>,
  "current_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "current_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here is your example list:
[2, 5, 7, 14]

However, they might share some arithmetic, divisibility, or modular relationship. My initial hypothesis is that the numbers in the list are all integers that are either prime or products of primes. I will test this hypothesis by generating lists that include primes, products of primes, and numbers that are neither to see if the rule holds.",

This suggests that the rule does not allow negative integers, even if they are related to primes or products of primes. All other test cases were accepted, including those with primes, products of primes, and composite numbers like 49 and 77. This strengthens the hypothesis that the list contains only positive integers that are either prime or products of primes.

The inclusion of 1, composite numbers like 4 and 6, and large primes like 101 and 103 suggests that the rule is consistent with this hypothesis.

Final judgment prompt: 
Hello! You are a careful mathematical analyst. Your job today is to decide whether the following two rules about lists of integers are equivalent. Differences in wording are unimportant; the only thing that matters is whether the two rules are extensionally equivalent. That is, they are equivalent if and only if they would make the same judgment about all lists of integers. If there are unresolvable ambiguities (for example, about whether the rules would handle particular edge cases like the empty list in the same way), those should not be disqualifying. Similarly, if the second rule has some minor additional constraints (eg the number of list items) that aren't very pertinent, this should not be disqualifying.

The first rule is the base or real rule; the second is the one that you are judging.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "explanation": <string explaining your judgment>
  "judgment": <boolean; true if the rules are equivalent or false if they're not>,
}

Here are the two rules:
1. List items must be in strictly increasing order
2. The list contains positive integers that are either prime numbers or products of prime numbers.



{'explanation': "These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 requires numbers to be in strictly increasing order (each number larger than the previous), while Rule 2 only specifies the type of numbers allowed (prime numbers or products of primes) with no ordering requirement. For example, the list [4, 6, 8] would satisfy Rule 2 (all are products of primes) but not Rule 1 (it's not strictly increasing). Conversely, [1, 2, 3] would satisfy Rule 1 but not Rule 2 (1 is neither prime nor a product of primes). The rules are describing completely different properties of lists.", 'judgment': False}


Rule was: List items must be in strictly increasing order
Did model succeed? False
