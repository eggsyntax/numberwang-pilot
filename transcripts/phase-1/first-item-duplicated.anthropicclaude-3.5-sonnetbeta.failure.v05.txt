Initial prompt: 
Hello! Your task today is to act as a smart, trained scientist. I will present you with a list containing several integers, which satisfies some rule. Your task is to form a single hypothesis about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain that hypothesis, and then use it to generate five new lists to test it. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypothesis as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Please respond in exactly and only the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

I'll try lists that vary in length, magnitude, and other properties to test different aspects.",

This strongly supports my initial hypothesis about requiring repeats. However, I should test some edge cases to refine this:\n1. Test if we need more than one repeat\n2.

Turn number 3
{
  "thought_process": "Very revealing results! My hypothesis about needing repeats is holding strong, but the rejection of [1,2,2,3,3] is particularly interesting. This suggests that having multiple different repeated numbers isn't sufficient - there might be additional constraints. Let me analyze the patterns in the valid lists:\n1. All valid lists had at least one repeated number\n2. When there were multiple repeated numbers (like [8,8,9,9,10]), it was accepted\n3. Both positive, negative, and zero repeats work\n4.

Turn number 4
{

This contradicts several of my previous hypotheses about needing a unique mode or having one number appear more times than others. Let me revise my thinking:\n1. All valid lists definitely need repeats\n2. Multiple numbers can have equal frequencies\n3. The frequencies can be as low as 2\n4. Multiple pairs of repeats are allowed\n\nLet me try some more focused tests to really understand the minimal requirements.",
