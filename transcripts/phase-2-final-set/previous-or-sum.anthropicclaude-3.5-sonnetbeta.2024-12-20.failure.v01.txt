Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[3, 3, 6, 9, 9, 18]
[7, 7, 14, 21]
[4, 4, 8]

Let me think about this systematically:

1) First observations:
- Each list contains at least one repeated number at the beginning
- After the repeated numbers, the values seem to increase
- The numbers after the repeated ones appear to be multiples of the repeated number

2) Pattern analysis:
- In [3,3,6,9,9,18]: 6=2×3, 9=3×3, 18=6×3
- In [7,7,14,21]: 14=2×7, 21=3×7
- In [4,4,8]: 8=2×4

3) Initial thoughts:
- The rule seems to involve starting with repeated numbers
- Subsequent numbers are multiples of the initial repeated number
- The sequence might allow for additional repeated numbers (like 9,9 in first list)
- Numbers appear to increase monotonically

Let me propose some test cases to distinguish between possible hypotheses.

Interesting results! This helps narrow things down significantly.

Key observations from the test results:
1. [5,5,10,15,20] was rejected - so either the sequence can't be purely consecutive multiples, or something else is wrong
2. [6,6,12] was accepted - confirms that minimal pattern of repeat + multiple works
3. [2,2,2,4,6,8] was rejected - so three initial repeats isn't allowed
4. [8,16,8,24] was rejected - so the repeated number must come first
5. [3,6,9,12] was rejected - confirms that initial repeat is required

The acceptance of [6,6,12] but rejection of [5,5,10,15,20] is particularly interesting. Perhaps there's a limit on how many multiples can follow? Or maybe they don't need to be consecutive multiples?

Let me test some more focused hypotheses.

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "The key insight from last round is that initial repeats are definitely required, and must come first. The rejection of [5,5,10,15,20] but acceptance of [6,6,12] suggests something about the nature or number of multiples that follow.

Hmm, this is quite intriguing! All my test cases were rejected, which suggests I'm still missing something fundamental about the pattern.

Let me review all accepted lists so far:
- [3, 3, 6, 9, 9, 18]
- [7, 7, 14, 21]
- [4, 4, 8]
- [6, 6, 12]

New observations:
1. Looking at the multiples that appear:
   - 3→6(×2),9(×3),18(×6)
   - 7→14(×2),21(×3)
   - 4→8(×2)
   - 6→12(×2)

Aha! I notice that in ALL accepted cases, the first multiple is exactly double the initial number! And looking further, any subsequent multiples seem to follow a specific pattern - they're either double the previous number or triple the initial number.

Let me test this more specific hypothesis.

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "I've noticed that the first multiple after the initial repeat is ALWAYS double the initial number. Additionally, subsequent multiples (when they exist) seem to follow a pattern of either being triple the initial number or double the previous number. This feels like a breakthrough observation.",

    "List starts with n repeated twice, followed by 2n, and optionally 3n",
    "List starts with n repeated twice, followed by 2n, and optionally more doubles",

This is a major breakthrough! The acceptance of the first three test cases and rejection of the last two gives us crucial information.

Let's analyze what we know:
1. [5,5,10] - Accepted (minimal case)
2. [5,5,10,15] - Accepted (adds ×3)
3. [8,8,16,24] - Accepted (same pattern)
4. [3,3,6,12] - Rejected (tried to double again instead of ×3)
5. [2,2,4,6,8] - Rejected (tried to use consecutive multiples)

Looking at ALL accepted sequences so far:
- [3,3,6,9,9,18]
- [7,7,14,21]
- [4,4,8]
- [6,6,12]
- [5,5,10]
- [5,5,10,15]
- [8,8,16,24]

The pattern is becoming very clear:
1. Must start with n repeated twice
2. Must then have 2n
3. After that, can only have:
   - 3n (a triple of the original)
   - Optional repeats of previous numbers
   - If a number is repeated, can follow with its double

Let me test this refined understanding.

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "We've made significant progress. The sequence must start with n,n,2n. After that, the only allowed next number is 3n. Any further numbers must either be repeats of previous numbers or doubles of repeated numbers. Let me test some edge cases to verify this pattern.",

    "List starts with n,n,2n, optionally followed by 3n",

Excellent! All test cases were accepted, which strongly supports our hypothesis. Let's verify if we've captured all the essential rules by reviewing what we know:

1. Required start: n,n,2n
2. After that, allowed numbers are:
   - 3n
   - Repeats of any previous number
   - If a number is repeated, its double can follow

This explains every accepted sequence we've seen and correctly predicted five new valid sequences. The rule is elegant and explains all observations without any contradictions.

Let me do one final round of tests with some edge cases to make absolutely sure:

<response>

  "thought_process": "Our hypothesis has been very successful. For final confirmation, I want to test some edge cases that might reveal any missing constraints. I'll test sequences that push the boundaries of our rules while still following them.",

    "List must begin n,n,2n, then allows 3n and/or repeats with their doubles",
    "Sequence requires n,n,2n start, then permits 3n and/or repeats followed by their doubles",
    "Must start n,n,2n, then allows only 3n or repeats (which enable their doubles)",
    "Initial n,n,2n required, followed by optional 3n and/or repeats with their doubles",
    "Starts with n,n,2n, then only 3n or repeats (whose doubles are allowed) can follow"
  ],

Aha! The rejection of [5,5,10,15,10,20] is very revealing. This shows an important constraint I hadn't fully captured: while we can repeat numbers, we can only double a number immediately after it appears (not after doing something else).

Now I'm confident I can state the complete rule:

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "The rejection of [5,5,10,15,10,20] was crucial - it showed that you can't go back to double an old number; you can only double a number immediately after it appears as a repeat. This was the last piece of the puzzle.",
