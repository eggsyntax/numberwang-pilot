Rule: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] follows the rule.

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]
[9, 46, 23, 116]
[14, 7, 36, 18]



Turn number 1
To analyze the provided lists and formulate possible hypotheses, let's examine the patterns and relationships between the numbers:

1. **First List:** [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]
   - 12 → 6 (halved)
   - 6 → 3 (halved)
   - 3 → 16
   - 16 → 8 (halved)
   - 8 → 4 (halved)

2. **Second List:** [9, 46, 23, 116]
   - 9 → 46
   - 46 → 23 (halved)
   - 23 → 116

3. **Third List:** [14, 7, 36, 18]
   - 14 → 7 (halved)
   - 7 → 36
   - 36 → 18 (halved)

**Observations:**
- When a number is even, it appears to be halved.
- When a number is odd, there's a more complex operation, possibly multiplication by a constant and addition.

**Possible Operation for Odd Numbers:**
- \( n \times 5 + 1 \)
  - 3 → \( 3 \times 5 + 1 = 16 \)
  - 9 → \( 9 \times 5 + 1 = 46 \)
  - 7 → \( 7 \times 5 + 1 = 36 \)
  - 23 → \( 23 \times 5 + 1 = 116 \)

This operation seems consistent across all provided lists.

Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] follows the rule.
Model rule: If a number is even, the next number is half of it; if odd, multiply by 5 and add 1.
Final judgment: {'explanation': 'These rules are exactly equivalent. Both describe the same mathematical sequence where for any number n: if n is even, the next number must be n/2; if n is odd, the next number must be 5n+1. The second rule is just a more concise wording of the first rule. The example sequence [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] would be valid under both rules, and any sequence that satisfies one rule would satisfy the other.', 'judgment': True}
