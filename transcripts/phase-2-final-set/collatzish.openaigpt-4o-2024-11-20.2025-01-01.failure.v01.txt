Rule: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] follows the rule.

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]
[9, 46, 23, 116]
[14, 7, 36, 18]

### Thought Process:
1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The first list contains integers that are a mix of even and odd numbers. Some are divisible by others (e.g., 12 is divisible by 6, 6 by 3, etc.), but not all pairs have this property.
   - The second list contains integers that are mostly odd (except 46 and 116). There’s no immediate divisibility pattern, but the numbers seem to grow larger.
   - The third list contains both even and odd numbers, with no clear divisibility or arithmetic progression.

2. **Initial Hypotheses**:
   - The rule might involve divisibility, but it doesn’t seem to apply universally across all lists.
   - The rule might involve relationships between numbers in the list (e.g., one number being a multiple or factor of another).
   - The rule might involve a property of individual numbers (e.g., prime factors, parity, or something else).
   - The rule might involve a combination of arithmetic operations (e.g., sums, differences, or products of numbers in the list).
   - The rule might involve a structural property of the list (e.g., the number of elements, their order, or their relative sizes).

3. **Brainstorming Hypotheses**:
   - I’ll start with six simple hypotheses that are compatible with the data:
     1. The list contains at least one even number.
     2. The list contains at least one odd number.
     3. The list contains at least one number that is a multiple of 3.
     4. The list contains at least one number that is a multiple of 7.
     5. The list contains at least one number that is a factor of another number in the list.
     6. The list contains at least one number that is greater than 10.

4. **Testing Hypotheses**:
   - I’ll generate five test cases to distinguish between these hypotheses. I’ll include cases that test for divisibility, parity, and relationships between numbers.

Rule was: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] follows the rule.
