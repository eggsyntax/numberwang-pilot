Rule: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] follows the rule.

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]
[9, 46, 23, 116]
[14, 7, 36, 18]

Here are my initial thoughts on the rule underlying these integer lists:

The first thing I notice is that all the numbers are positive integers. Within each list, the numbers seem to be in descending order, except for the last number in the first list (4) which is smaller than the second-to-last (8).

Some possible mathematical relationships between the numbers in each list:
- In the first list, each number (except the last) is half the previous number. The last number 4 is half of 8.
- In the second list, each number is about double the previous, plus 1 (9 * 2 + 1 = 19; 23 * 2 + 1 = 47; 47 * 2 + 1 = 95). But 116 doesn't quite fit this pattern. 
- In the third list, each number is double the previous.

There are some other potential patterns, like the numbers being even or odd, or all lists having at least 3 elements. But those seem less likely to be the main rule.

To test these, I'll generate lists that fit some of these patterns but break others, to try to narrow down which relationships actually matter. I'll also test some edge cases, like very small numbers, huge numbers, negative numbers, and non-integers to see if those are allowed.
