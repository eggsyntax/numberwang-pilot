Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[5, 24, 17, 21]
[19, 3, 16, 11]
[10, 2, 9, 4, 7]

Alright, let's get started! I'll begin by making some initial observations about the given lists. Each list contains four unique integers, and the numbers within each list seem to be in ascending order. The numbers themselves don't seem to follow any obvious pattern, so I'll start with some simple hypotheses and test them.

My initial thought is that the rule might be related to the sum or range of the numbers in each list. Let's call the lists List A, List B, and List C for convenience.

**Hypothesis 1:** The sum of the numbers in each list is a multiple of 5.

**Hypothesis 2:** The range (difference between the largest and smallest numbers) of each list is a prime number.

**Hypothesis 3:** The numbers in each list form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.

Now, let's propose some test cases to validate or refute these hypotheses:

{
  "thought_process": "Starting with basic pattern recognition, I notice that each list contains four unique integers in ascending order. I'll begin with simple hypotheses related to sums, differences, and sequences.",
  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "The sum of the numbers in each list is divisible by 5.",
    "The range of each list is a prime number.",
    "The numbers form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference.",
    "The numbers are multiples of consecutive integers.",
    "The numbers are related to a specific mathematical function.",
    "The numbers are constrained by a modular arithmetic rule."
  ],
  "leading_hypothesis": "The leading hypothesis is currently a combination of Hypotheses 1 and 2.",
  "test_cases": [
    [7, 12, 17, 22],
    [2, 5, 11, 17],
    [3, 6, 9, 12, 15],
    [13, 17, 23, 29],
    [4, 10, 12, 15]
  ]
}

Now, I'll wait for your feedback on which of these test cases satisfy the rule. Based on that information, I'll refine or replace my hypotheses and propose new test cases. Let's work together to crack this puzzle!

The feedback suggests that our hypotheses are becoming more intricate, but we are still missing some key patterns. Let's refine our thinking and consider constraints related to the count of odd and even integers within the lists.

Possible hypotheses:
1. The lists contain an even count of odd integers and an odd count of even integers.
2. The lists contain at least one integer that is a multiple of 3 and the count of odd integers is not divisible by 4.
3. The lists contain at least one integer that is a multiple of 8 and the count of even integers is not divisible by 3.
4. The lists contain at least one integer with a sum of digits divisible by 3 and the count of odd integers is odd.
5. The lists contain at least one integer that is a multiple of 5 and the count of even integers is even.
6. The lists contain at least one integer that is a prime number and the count of odd integers is prime.

Leading hypothesis: The lists contain integers that follow specific patterns related to the count of odd and even numbers, as well as various number theory constraints.

Test cases:
1. [3, 5, 15, 21]
2. [6, 9, 12, 24]
3. [4, 7, 18, 22]
4. [8, 11, 14, 23]

The feedback suggests that our hypotheses related to the ratios between consecutive integers are not capturing the underlying rule. Let's take a step back and consider a combination of patterns we've explored so far, including constraints on the individual integers, their sums, averages, differences, ratios, digital roots, and other number theory properties.

Possible hypotheses:
1. The lists contain at least one integer that is a multiple of 6, the sum is divisible by 3, and the ratio between consecutive integers is always 1:2, 1:3, or 2:3.
2. The lists contain at least one integer that is a perfect square, the digital root of the sum is 1, 4, or 7, and the ratio between consecutive integers is never a prime number.
3. The lists contain at least one integer that is not a multiple of its position, the sum is not divisible by 4, and the ratio between consecutive integers is never a perfect square.
4. The lists contain at least one integer with a digital root of 1, 4, or 7, the sum is a perfect square, and the ratio between consecutive integers is never a multiple of their position ratio.
5. The lists contain at least one integer that is not a perfect fourth power, the digital root of the sum is prime, and the ratio between consecutive integers is never a perfect cube.
6. The lists contain at least one integer that is a multiple of 4 or 9, the digital root of the sum is not divisible by 3, and the ratio between consecutive integers is always an integer.

Leading hypothesis: The lists contain integers that adhere to a complex combination of patterns we've explored, including constraints on individual numbers, their sums, averages, differences, ratios, digital roots, and other number theory properties.

Test cases:
1. [6, 12, 15, 24]
2. [4, 9, 16, 25]
3. [3, 8, 12, 20]
4. [7, 14, 21, 28]
5. [5, 15, 20, 25]

The feedback suggests that our hypotheses, despite their complexity and various combinations, are still not capturing the underlying rule. Let's take a step back and consider a different combination of patterns we've explored so far, focusing on constraints related to the individual integers, their sums, averages, differences, ratios, and other number theory properties.

Possible hypotheses:
1. The lists contain at least one integer that is a multiple of 6, the sum is not divisible by 4, and the ratio between consecutive integers is never a prime number.
2. The lists contain at least one integer that is a perfect square, the digital root of the sum is not divisible by 3, and the ratio between consecutive integers is always 1:2, 1:3, or 2:3.

Rule was: Each element must be in between the preceding two elements (the first two elements can be anything)
Did cohere/command-r-plus succeed? False
