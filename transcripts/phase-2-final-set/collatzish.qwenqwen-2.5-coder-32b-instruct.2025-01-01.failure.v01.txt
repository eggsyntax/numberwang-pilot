Rule: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] follows the rule.

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]
[9, 46, 23, 116]
[14, 7, 36, 18]

Let's start by analyzing the given lists to find patterns or rules that could be at play:

- The first list is [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]. Here, the sequence alternates between dividing by 2 and multiplying by some factor (or vice versa). After 12 divided by 2 three times, the sequence jumps to 16, which is 8 * 2, and then continues dividing by 2.
- The second list is [9, 46, 23, 116]. Here, the sequence alternates between multiplying by some factor and dividing by 2. 9 * 5 = 46, 46 / 2 = 23, and 23 * 5 = 116.
- The third list is [14, 7, 36, 18]. Here, 14 / 2 = 7, and then 7 * 5 = 36, and 36 / 2 = 18.

From the above observations, we can hypothesize some rules:
1. The lists alternate between division by 2 and multiplication by a factor.
2. The factor of multiplication might be 5.
3. The sequence might start with any integer and follow alternating operations with 2 and 5.
4. The sequence might start with an even number and then alternate operations, but it's not a strict rule since 9 (odd) is in one of the lists.
5. The sequence might have a fixed length of 6.
6. The sequence might end with a number that is divisible by 2.

Let's design test cases that will help us distinguish between these hypotheses:

Given that none of the proposed lists satisfy the rule, let's refine our hypotheses and design new test cases. The previous hypotheses were based on the assumption that the lists alternate between division by 2 and multiplication by a factor, possibly 5. Since these did not work, we need to consider other possibilities.

Let's explore different patterns and rules:

1. The lists might alternate between division by 2 and multiplication by a different factor.
2. The lists might follow a different pattern of operations.
3. The lists might start with an odd number and follow a specific rule.
4. The lists might have a specific starting number and follow a pattern of operations.
5. The lists might have a specific length and follow a pattern of operations.

Given that none of the proposed lists satisfy the rule, it's time to rethink the underlying pattern. Let's explore some new hypotheses by considering different operations and sequences:

1. The lists might follow a pattern involving repeated operations of division by 2.
2. The lists might involve multiplication by a factor other than 5 and division by 2.
3. The lists might start with an even number and follow a specific sequence of operations.
4. The lists might involve a combination of operations that are not strictly alternating.

Let's test this hypothesis further by creating new lists that follow this pattern and some that do not:

1. The list involves repeated division by 2 starting from an even number.
2. The list involves repeated division by 2 starting from an odd number.
