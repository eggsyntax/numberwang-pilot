Rule: Each element is either divisible by the previous element, or is equal to the previous element plus 13. The first two elements can be anything. For example [2, 6, 19, 38, 51]

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[2, 6, 19, 38, 51]
[3, 6, 19, 32, 96]
[1, 2, 8, 21]

Let me think about this systematically.

Initial observations:
1. Lists have varying lengths (one has 4 numbers, others have 5)
2. Numbers appear to be positive integers
3. Numbers generally increase within each list
4. Some numbers appear in multiple lists (6, 19)
5. No obvious simple arithmetic sequence

Let me analyze potential patterns:
- Looking at differences between consecutive numbers:
  [2,6,19,38,51]: +4, +13, +19, +13
  [3,6,19,32,96]: +3, +13, +13, +64
  [1,2,8,21]: +1, +6, +13

I notice some patterns:
- The number 13 appears frequently in differences
- All lists start with small numbers (1-3)
- Second numbers are relatively small (2-6)
- Later numbers get progressively larger

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "I'm seeing some patterns but need to test various hypotheses. The presence of 13 in differences and increasing magnitudes suggests some kind of multiplicative or exponential growth, but with possible variations. The varying list lengths suggest the rule might be flexible about length.",
  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "Each number after the second must be larger than the sum of the two previous numbers",
    "Each list must start with a number ≤3 and increase by at least 1 each time",
    "The difference between consecutive numbers must increase at least once in the sequence",
    "Each number after the first two must be at least 3 times the previous number",
    "The ratio between consecutive numbers must increase at least once",
    "Each list must contain at least one difference of 13 between consecutive numbers"
  ],
  "leading_hypothesis": "Each number after the second must be larger than the sum of the two previous numbers",

Interesting - all of my test cases were rejected! This suggests my hypotheses were too lenient. The fact that none of these worked suggests the rule must be more restrictive.

Let me look at the original lists again:
[2, 6, 19, 38, 51]
[3, 6, 19, 32, 96]
[1, 2, 8, 21]

New observations:
1. The jumps between numbers seem to be more dramatic than in my test cases
2. Looking at ratios between consecutive numbers:
   List 1: 3x, ~3.2x, 2x, 1.34x
   List 2: 2x, 3.17x, 1.68x, 3x
   List 3: 2x, 4x, 2.625x

3. The number 6 appears in two lists, and 19 appears in two lists - this might be significant
4. All valid lists have at least one number that's more than triple its predecessor

Let me try some more extreme test cases to better understand the boundaries.

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "My previous test cases were too conservative. The real pattern seems to involve more dramatic increases. I'll test some sequences with larger jumps and try to include some numbers from the original sequences to see if that helps identify the pattern.",

Very interesting! Only two sequences were accepted. Let me analyze what makes these special:

[1, 3, 9, 28, 45] - Accepted
[1, 4, 13, 32, 51] - Accepted

Original valid sequences:
[2, 6, 19, 38, 51]
[3, 6, 19, 32, 96]
[1, 2, 8, 21]

Looking at the ratios in the newly accepted sequences:
[1, 3, 9, 28, 45]: 3x, 3x, 3.11x, 1.61x
[1, 4, 13, 32, 51]: 4x, 3.25x, 2.46x, 1.59x

New observations:
1. Both accepted sequences start with 1
2. Both have very strong early growth (3x or 4x)
3. Both end with 51 or 45 (similar range)
4. Looking at differences between consecutive numbers, they grow significantly early on

Let me try some sequences that follow these patterns more strictly.

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "The acceptance of sequences starting with 1 and having strong early growth is notable.

    "The sequence must start with 1 and have at least one triple increase",
    "Each number must be larger than all previous numbers combined",
    "The second number must be at least triple the first, and subsequent increases must be at least double",

Fascinating! Only [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] was accepted. This is a crucial insight because this sequence has a very special property - each number is exactly double its predecessor.

Let's look at all valid sequences we know:
[2, 6, 19, 38, 51]
[3, 6, 19, 32, 96]
[1, 2, 8, 21]
[1, 3, 9, 28, 45]
[1, 4, 13, 32, 51]
[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]

The acceptance of [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] is particularly interesting because it's a geometric sequence with ratio 2. This suggests the rule might be related to geometric growth or ratios.

Let me try some more sequences focusing on geometric progressions and variations.

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "The acceptance of the geometric sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] is a key insight. However, other accepted sequences don't follow this exact pattern. Let me test some geometric sequences with different ratios and starting points to better understand the boundaries.",

    "Each number must be at least double its predecessor",
    "The sequence must follow geometric progression with ratio ≥2",

This is a very revealing result! Let's analyze what we know:

Valid sequences:
[2, 6, 19, 38, 51]
[3, 6, 19, 32, 96]
[1, 2, 8, 21]
[1, 3, 9, 28, 45]
[1, 4, 13, 32, 51]
[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
[1, 2, 4, 16, 32]
[2, 4, 8, 16, 32]

The acceptance of [1, 2, 4, 16, 32] and [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] but rejection of the others is very telling. These sequences, along with [1, 2, 4, 8, 16], share a crucial property: each number is at least double its predecessor.

This seems to be a necessary condition, but might not be sufficient given our earlier results. Let me test this hypothesis more rigorously.

Very interesting! Let's analyze all known valid sequences:

[2, 6, 19, 38, 51]
[3, 6, 19, 32, 96]
[1, 2, 8, 21]
[1, 3, 9, 28, 45]
[1, 4, 13, 32, 51]
[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
[1, 2, 4, 16, 32]
[2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
[3, 6, 12, 24, 48]
[1, 2, 6, 12, 24]
[1, 3, 6, 12, 24]

The acceptance of [1, 3, 6, 12, 24] and rejection of [2, 5, 10, 20, 40] and [2, 4, 9, 18, 36] is particularly revealing.

Let me check each number against its predecessor in the newly accepted sequences:
[3, 6, 12, 24, 48]: 2x, 2x, 2x, 2x
[1, 2, 6, 12, 24]: 2x, 3x, 2x, 2x
[1, 3, 6, 12, 24]: 3x, 2x, 2x, 2x

The rejected sequences had some ratios less than 2x.

I'm now quite confident about the rule!
