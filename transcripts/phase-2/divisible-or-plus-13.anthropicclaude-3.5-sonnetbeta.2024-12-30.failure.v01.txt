Rule: Each element is either divisible by the previous element, or is equal to the previous element plus 13. The first two elements can be anything. For example [2, 6, 19, 38, 51]

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[2, 6, 19, 38, 51]
[3, 6, 19, 32, 96]
[1, 2, 8, 21]

Let me think about this systematically.

Initial observations:
1. Lists have varying lengths (one has 4 numbers, others have 5)
2. Numbers appear to be positive integers
3. Numbers generally increase within each list
4. Some numbers appear in multiple lists (6, 19)
5. No obvious simple arithmetic sequence

Possible patterns to consider:
- Could involve operations between consecutive numbers
- Might involve prime factors
- Could be related to digit properties
- Might involve modular arithmetic
- Could involve position-dependent rules

Let me propose some test cases to help distinguish between different hypotheses:

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "I need to test several different types of patterns. I'll include some small numbers, some large numbers, and some edge cases to help eliminate incorrect hypotheses. I want to test both simple arithmetic relationships and more complex patterns.",
  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "Each number after the first is the sum of previous number plus a growing increment",
    "Each number has at least one prime factor in common with the next number",
    "The difference between consecutive numbers follows a pattern based on position",
    "Each number when divided by its position gives a remainder that follows a pattern",
    "Numbers are chosen so each pair's GCD is greater than 1",
    "Each number's digits sum to a value that forms a sequence"
  ],
  "leading_hypothesis": "Each number after the first is derived from the previous number through a position-dependent operation",
  "test_cases": [
    [2, 4, 12, 28, 55],
    [5, 10, 25, 50, 100],

Interesting results! Let me analyze what we learned:

1. [2, 4, 12, 28, 55] - Valid
2. [5, 10, 25, 50, 100] - Invalid
3. [7, 14, 28, 56] - Valid
4. [11, 22, 44, 88] - Valid
5. [1, 3, 9, 27, 81] - Valid

Key observations from the results:
1. Geometric sequences (like [5,10,25,50,100]) are NOT always valid
2. Several valid sequences show doubling in early positions ([7,14,28...], [11,22,44...])
3. The pattern seems to allow for both exponential-like growth and other types of growth

Let me refine my thinking:
- Early positions often show multiplication by 2
- Later positions might follow a different rule
- The rule might change based on position
- The relationship between consecutive numbers might be multiplicative early and then switch to additive

Let me test some more focused cases:

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "I'm now focusing on sequences that start with doubling but then potentially change their behavior. I want to test if there's a consistent position where the pattern changes, and what that change might be. I'm also including some variations to test the boundaries of the pattern.",
  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "Numbers double until position 3, then follow a different rule",
    "Each position has a specific multiplier (2x, then 1.5x, then 1.25x, etc)",
    "Numbers double until reaching a threshold, then switch to additive growth",
    "Each number is doubled and then can optionally add a small increment",
    "The sequence alternates between doubling and adding position-dependent values",
    "Each number is derived from all previous numbers using a position-specific formula"
  ],
  "leading_hypothesis": "Numbers double for the first few positions, then switch to a different growth pattern based on position",

Very interesting! This is quite revealing.

Key observations:
1. [4, 8, 16, 32, 64] is the ONLY valid sequence from my tests
2. This sequence is a pure geometric sequence with ratio 2
3. Looking back at previous valid sequences:
   - [7, 14, 28, 56] - doubles throughout
   - [11, 22, 44, 88] - doubles throughout
   - [1, 3, 9, 27, 81] - triples throughout
   - [2, 4, 12, 28, 55] - doubles then changes

This suggests something profound:
- Geometric sequences with ratio 2 are always valid
- Some other geometric sequences (ratio 3) might be valid
- Some sequences that start geometric but deviate are valid
- Pure geometric sequences with other ratios (like 2.5) are invalid

Let me test this more precisely:

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "I'm now focusing on testing various geometric sequences and near-geometric sequences. I want to understand exactly which ratios are allowed and whether deviations from geometric progression are allowed at specific positions. I'll test pure geometric sequences with different ratios and some sequences that start geometric but deviate.",
  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "Any geometric sequence with ratio 2 or 3 is valid",
    "A sequence must be geometric with integer ratio until position 4",
    "A sequence must double or triple each term until it reaches a threshold",
    "Each term must be a power of 2 times the first term",
    "The sequence must follow powers of a single integer (2 or 3)",
    "Each term must be divisible by all previous terms"
  ],
  "leading_hypothesis": "A sequence is valid if it's either a pure geometric sequence with ratio 2 or 3, or starts geometric and deviates only in later positions",
  "test_cases": [
    [3, 9, 27, 81, 243],

This is a fascinating development! Let me analyze what we know:

Valid sequences include:
1. Pure doubling: [4, 8, 16, 32, 64]
2. Pure tripling: [1, 3, 9, 27, 81], [3, 9, 27, 81, 243]
3. Pure tripling with different starts: [2, 6, 18, 54, 162], [4, 12, 36, 108, 324], [8, 24, 72, 216, 648], [5, 15, 45, 135, 405]
4. Some sequences that deviate: [2, 6, 19, 38, 51], [3, 6, 19, 32, 96]

Invalid sequences include:
- [5, 10, 25, 50, 100] (×2, ×2.5, ×2, ×2)
- [2, 4, 8, 16, 24] (doubles then adds 8)

Let me test some more specific cases to understand the boundaries:

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "I now see that both ×2 and ×3 geometric sequences are valid, regardless of starting number. I want to test: 1) if other integer ratios work, 2) what kinds of deviations are allowed, and 3) if there are any constraints on the starting number.",
  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "A sequence is valid if each term is multiplied by either 2 or 3",
    "A sequence is valid if it multiplies each term by any fixed integer",
    "A sequence is valid if each term is multiplied by a fixed integer or deviates after position 3",
    "A sequence must follow ×2 or ×3 until position 3, then can deviate",
    "A sequence must maintain the same multiplier (2 or 3) throughout unless it deviates after position 3",
    "Each term must be a multiple of the first term by either powers of 2 or powers of 3"
  ],
  "leading_hypothesis": "A sequence is valid if it either: 1) multiplies each term by 2 or 3 throughout, or 2) follows this pattern for at least 3 terms then may deviate",

This is getting very interesting! Let me analyze what we know:

Valid sequences now include:
1. Pure ×2: [4, 8, 16, 32, 64], [11, 22, 44, 88]
2. Pure ×3: [1, 3, 9, 27, 81], [3, 9, 27, 81, 243]
3. Pure ×4: [1, 4, 16, 64, 256], [2, 8, 32, 128, 512]
4. Mixed multipliers: [2, 8, 32, 96, 288]
5. Deviating sequences: [2, 6, 19, 38, 51]

Key insights:
1. It seems ANY integer multiplier might be valid (×2, ×3, ×4)
2. The sequence can switch multipliers (as in [2, 8, 32, 96, 288] which is ×4, ×4, ×3, ×3)
3. Starting number doesn't seem to matter

Let me test some more extreme cases:

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "I want to test: 1) larger multipliers, 2) switching between different multipliers, 3) negative numbers, and 4) more complex patterns of multiplication. I'm starting to suspect that each term just needs to be a multiple of the previous term.",
  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "Each term must be a positive integer multiple of the previous term",
    "Each term must be an integer multiple of all previous terms",
    "Each term must be a multiple of the first term",
    "The ratio between consecutive terms must be a positive integer",
    "Each term must divide evenly into the next term",
    "The sequence must represent repeated multiplication by any positive integer"
  ],

This is a major breakthrough! Let's analyze what we've confirmed:

1. ALL sequences where each term is a positive integer multiple of the previous term are valid
2. Even negative numbers work as long as they follow this rule
3. The multiplier can:
   - Be any integer (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...)
   - Change between terms
   - Be different for different sequences
4. The starting number can be any integer

Let me do one final round of testing to verify this is the complete rule:

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "I'm now confident about the rule but want to test some edge cases to verify there are no additional constraints. I'll test: very large multipliers, very large numbers, switching between small and large multipliers, and some unusual patterns.",

    "Each term must be an integer multiple of the previous term",
    "Each term must be divisible by the previous term",
    "The ratio between consecutive terms must be a whole number",
    "Each term must share all prime factors of the previous term plus possibly more",
    "Each subsequent number must be divisible by its predecessor",
    "The sequence represents repeated integer multiplication with any multiplier"
  ],
  "leading_hypothesis": "A sequence is valid if and only if each term is an integer multiple of the previous term",

Aha! This last test revealed something crucial I was missing!

Looking at the invalid sequences:
- [2, 14, 98, 686] is invalid even though each term is a multiple of the previous (×7, ×7, ×7)
- [1, 2, 8, 48, 384] is invalid even though each term is a multiple of the previous (×2, ×4, ×6, ×8)

Looking back at all valid sequences:
- [1, 100, 10000, 1000000] (×100, ×100, ×100) - valid
- [3, 21, 147, 1029] (×7, ×7, ×7) - valid
- [5, 35, 245, 1715] (×7, ×7, ×7) - valid

The key insight: The multiplier must be CONSISTENT throughout the sequence! If you start multiplying by 7, you must continue multiplying by 7. If you start multiplying by 100, you must continue multiplying by 100.

I'm now confident enough to state my final hypothesis:

<response>

{
  "thought_process": "The last test revealed that while each term must be a multiple of the previous term, the multiplier must remain constant throughout the sequence. This explains why some sequences with changing multipliers were invalid, even though each term was a multiple of the previous one.",
  "final_hypothesis": "A sequence is valid if and only if each term is equal to the previous term multiplied by the same integer multiplier throughout the sequence. In other words, it must be a geometric sequence with a constant integer ratio.",
  "test_cases": [
    [2, 12, 72, 432, 2592],
    [1, 7, 49, 343, 2401],

    [4, 28, 196, 1372, 9604],
    [1, 11, 121, 1331, 14641]
  ]
}
Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  Each element is either divisible by the previous element, or is equal to the previous element plus 13. The first two elements can be anything. For example [2, 6, 19, 38, 51]
Model rule: A sequence is valid if and only if each term is equal to the previous term multiplied by the same integer multiplier throughout the sequence. In other words, it must be a geometric sequence with a constant integer ratio.
Final judgment: {'explanation': 'These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 allows two different relationships between consecutive terms: either division or adding 13. For example, [2, 6, 19, 38, 51] is valid under Rule 1 because 6 is divisible by 2, 19 = 6 + 13, 38 is divisible by 19, and 51 = 38 + 13. However, Rule 2 only allows geometric sequences where each term is a multiple of the previous term by the same integer factor throughout. The sequence [2, 6, 19, 38, 51] would not be valid under Rule 2 because there is no constant integer ratio between consecutive terms.', 'judgment': False}
