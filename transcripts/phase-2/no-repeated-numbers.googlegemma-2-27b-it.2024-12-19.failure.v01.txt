Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[4, 11, 8, 6]
[9, 99, 1, 12]
[3, 18, 11, 7, 12]

The numbers are quite diverse in size. Let's consider some initial hypotheses:\n\n1. **Prime Numbers:**  Could the rule involve prime numbers? Not all lists seem to have only primes.\n2. **Sum/Product:** Is there a specific sum or product that the numbers in each list must satisfy?\n3. **Digit Patterns:** Do the digits within the numbers follow a pattern (e.g., repeating digits, increasing/decreasing digits)?\n4. **Positional Rule:** Does the position of a number in the list influence its value?\n5. **Randomness:** Could the lists be randomly generated with no underlying rule?\n6. **Modular Arithmetic:** Do the numbers share a common remainder when divided by a specific number?\n\nI'll start by testing hypotheses related to sums, products, and digit patterns.",

Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  There are no repeated numbers in the list.
Model rule: The sum of the numbers in each list is a prime number, and the numbers are in ascending order. Each list contains exactly one number with a repeating digit, and that repeating digit is the first digit of the smallest number in the list.
Final judgment: {'explanation': 'These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 simply requires that no number appears more than once in the list. Rule 2 has multiple different requirements: (a) the sum must be prime, (b) numbers must be in ascending order, (c) exactly one number must have a repeating digit, and (d) that digit must match the first digit of the smallest number. For example, [1, 2, 3] would satisfy Rule 1 but not Rule 2 (no repeating digits). Conversely, [11, 14, 20] would satisfy Rule 2 (sum=45 is prime, ascending order, 11 has repeating digit that matches first digit of smallest number) but not Rule 1 (no repeated numbers).', 'judgment': False}
