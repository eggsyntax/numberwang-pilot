Rule: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16] follows the rule.

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16]
[4, 2, 1, 6, 3]
[14, 7, 36, 18]

### Thought Process:
1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The lists contain integers, and the numbers seem to vary widely in magnitude.
   - The lists are not sorted, and there is no immediately obvious arithmetic or geometric progression.
   - Some numbers are even, and others are odd, so parity alone is not the rule.
   - The lists are of different lengths, so the rule likely applies to individual numbers rather than the structure of the list itself.

2. **Patterns to Consider**:
   - **Divisibility**: Many numbers in the lists are divisible by smaller numbers in the same list (e.g., in `[12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16]`, 12 is divisible by 6 and 3).
   - **Ratios**: Some numbers might be related by multiplication or division (e.g., `[4, 2, 1, 6, 3]` has 6 = 2 × 3, and 4 = 2 × 2).
   - **Prime Numbers**: There are no obvious primes in the lists, so primality might not be relevant.
   - **Odd/Even Mix**: Both odd and even numbers appear, so parity alone is not the rule.

3. **Hypotheses**:
   - I will brainstorm six possible hypotheses that could explain the rule. These will range from simple to more complex.

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - I will generate five new lists to test these hypotheses. The goal is to falsify as many hypotheses as possible or narrow down the possibilities.

---

### Possible Hypotheses:
1. **H1**: Each number in the list is divisible by at least one other number in the same list.
2. **H2**: Each number in the list is either a multiple or a factor of the sum of all numbers in the list.
3. **H3**: Each number in the list is either even or divisible by 3.
4. **H4**: The list contains at least one pair of numbers where one is double the other.
5. **H5**: The list contains at least one pair of numbers where one is divisible by the other.
6. **H6**: The list contains at least one number that is a power of 2.

---

### Test Cases:
1. `[8, 4, 2, 16]` (All powers of 2, divisible by each other).
2. `[9, 3, 27, 81]` (All powers of 3, divisible by each other).
3. `[7, 14, 28, 56]` (All multiples of 7, with doubling relationships).
4. `[5, 10, 15, 20]` (All multiples of 5, with divisibility relationships).
5. `[11, 22, 33, 44]` (Mixed odd/even, divisible by 11).

### Thought Process:
1. **Results Analysis**:
   - None of the test cases satisfied the rule, which means all six initial hypotheses are incorrect.
   - This suggests that the rule is not based on simple divisibility, powers, or doubling relationships.
   - I need to revisit the original lists and look for new patterns or relationships.

2. **Revisiting the Original Lists**:
   - `[12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16]`: 
     - Contains both even and odd numbers.
     - 12 is divisible by 6 and 3, but 10 and 5 are not divisible by others in the list.
     - 16 is a power of 2, but not all numbers are powers of 2.
   - `[4, 2, 1, 6, 3]`: 
     - 4 is divisible by 2, and 6 is divisible by 3.
     - 1 is a factor of all numbers.
   - `[14, 7, 36, 18]`: 
     - 14 is divisible by 7.
     - 36 and 18 are divisible by 2 and 3.

   - There seems to be no consistent divisibility or factor/multiple relationship across all numbers in each list.

3. **New Observations**:
   - The lists might involve a more abstract or less obvious property.
   - The rule could involve:
     - **Arithmetic properties**: Differences, sums, or modular relationships.
     - **Digit-based properties**: Sum of digits, parity of digits, or specific digit patterns.
     - **Set-based properties**: Relationships between subsets of numbers in the list.

4. **New Hypotheses**:
   - I will brainstorm six new hypotheses based on these observations.

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - I will generate five new test cases to test these hypotheses, focusing on distinguishing between them.

### Possible Hypotheses:
1. **H1**: The sum of all numbers in the list is even.
2. **H2**: The sum of the digits of all numbers in the list is odd.
3. **H3**: Each number in the list has at least one digit in common with another number in the list.
4. **H4**: The difference between the largest and smallest number in the list is a multiple of 3.
5. **H5**: The product of all numbers in the list is divisible by 6.
6. **H6**: Each number in the list is greater than or equal to the sum of all smaller numbers in the list.

---

### Test Cases:
1. `[2, 4, 6, 8]` (All even numbers, sum is even, no shared digits).
2. `[1, 3, 5, 7]` (All odd numbers, sum is odd, no shared digits).
3. `[12, 21, 13, 31]` (Shared digits between numbers, sum is even).
4. `[10, 20, 30, 40]` (All multiples of 10, no shared digits).
5. `[3, 6, 9, 12]` (All multiples of 3, sum is even).

### Thought Process:
1. **Results Analysis**:
   - None of the new test cases satisfied the rule, which means all six new hypotheses are incorrect.
   - This suggests that the rule is not based on simple arithmetic properties (e.g., sums, products, or differences), digit-based properties (e.g., shared digits), or set-based relationships (e.g., comparisons between numbers).

2. **Revisiting the Original Lists Again**:

     - **Positional relationships**: The position of a number in the list might matter.
     - **Relative magnitudes**: The rule could involve comparisons between numbers (e.g., increasing, decreasing, or alternating patterns).

4. **New Hypotheses**:
   - I will brainstorm six new hypotheses based on these observations.

5. **Testing Strategy**:

### Possible Hypotheses:

2. **H2**: The numbers in the list are in strictly increasing order.
3. **H3**: The numbers in the list are in strictly decreasing order.
4. **H4**: The sum of the first two numbers in the list equals the third number.
5. **H5**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of all numbers in the list is greater than 1.
6. **H6**: The product of all numbers in the list is a perfect square.

### Test Cases:
1. `[2, 3, 4, 5]` (Alternating even/odd, increasing order).
2. `[10, 20, 30, 40]` (Strictly increasing order, GCD = 10).
3. `[40, 30, 20, 10]` (Strictly decreasing order, GCD = 10).
4. `[3, 6, 9]` (Sum of first two equals third, GCD = 3).
5. `[4, 16, 64]` (Product is a perfect square).

   - The rule might involve:
     - **Relationships between subsets of numbers**: Perhaps the rule applies to specific pairs or groups of numbers within the list.
     - **External properties**: The rule might involve something less obvious, like the number of divisors, prime factorization, or other mathematical properties.
     - **Structural properties**: The rule might involve the structure of the list itself (e.g., length, arrangement).

4. **New Hypotheses**:
   - I will brainstorm six new hypotheses based on these observations.

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - I will generate five new test cases to test these hypotheses, focusing on subsets, external properties, and structural properties.

### Possible Hypotheses:
1. **H1**: The list contains at least one even number and one odd number.
2. **H2**: The list contains at least one prime number.
3. **H3**: The sum of all numbers in the list is a multiple of 4.
4. **H4**: The product of all numbers in the list is odd.
5. **H5**: The list contains at least one number that is a perfect square.
6. **H6**: The list contains at least one pair of numbers where one is divisible by the other.

---

### Test Cases:
1. `[2, 3, 5, 7]` (Contains primes, odd product).
2. `[4, 8, 16, 32]` (All even, contains perfect squares).
3. `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (Contains even and odd, sum is 10).
4. `[9, 27, 81]` (All odd, contains perfect squares).
5. `[6, 12, 18, 24]` (All even, divisible by 6).

### Thought Process:
1. **Results Analysis**:
   - None of the test cases satisfied the rule, which means all six hypotheses are incorrect.
   - This strongly suggests that the rule is not based on simple arithmetic properties, divisibility, primes, perfect squares, or even/odd relationships.
   - I need to take a completely fresh approach and consider more abstract or unconventional possibilities.

2. **Revisiting the Original Lists**:
   - `[12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16]`: 
     - Contains both even and odd numbers.
     - Numbers like 12, 6, and 3 are divisible by 3, but 10, 5, and 16 are not.
     - Numbers like 16 and 10 are powers of 2 or close to powers of 2, but not all numbers fit this pattern.
   - `[4, 2, 1, 6, 3]`: 
     - Contains both even and odd numbers.
     - 4, 2, and 6 are divisible by 2, but 1 and 3 are not.
   - `[14, 7, 36, 18]`: 
     - Contains both even and odd numbers.
     - 14 and 7 are divisible by 7, while 36 and 18 are divisible by 2 and 3.

   - This strongly suggests that the rule is not based on simple arithmetic properties, divisibility, primes, perfect squares, or even/odd relationships.
   - I need to take a completely fresh approach and consider more abstract or unconventional possibilities.

2. **Revisiting the Original Lists**:
   - `[12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16]`: 
     - Contains both even and odd numbers.
     - Numbers like 12, 6, and 3 are divisible by 3, but 10, 5, and 16 are not.
     - Numbers like 16 and 10 are powers of 2 or close to powers of 2, but not all numbers fit this pattern.
   - `[4, 2, 1, 6, 3]`: 
     - Contains both even and odd numbers.
     - 4, 2, and 6 are divisible by 2, but 1 and 3 are not.
   - `[14, 7, 36, 18]`: 
     - Contains both even and odd numbers.
     - 14 and 7 are divisible by 7, while 36 and 18 are divisible by 2 and 3.

   - There is no clear arithmetic, positional, or digit-based property that applies to all numbers in each list.

3. **New Observations**:
   - The rule might involve:
     - **Relationships between subsets of numbers**: Perhaps the rule applies to specific pairs or groups of numbers within the list.
     - **External properties**: The rule might involve something less obvious, like the number of divisors, prime factorization, or other mathematical properties.
     - **Structural properties**: The rule might involve the structure of the list itself (e.g., length, arrangement).

4. **New Hypotheses**:
   - I will brainstorm six new hypotheses based on these observations.

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - I will generate five new test cases to test these hypotheses, focusing on subsets, external properties, and structural properties.

Rule was: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16] follows the rule.
