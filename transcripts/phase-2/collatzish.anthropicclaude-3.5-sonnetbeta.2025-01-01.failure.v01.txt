Rule: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] follows the rule.

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]
[9, 46, 23, 116]
[14, 7, 36, 18]

Let me think about this systematically:

1) First observations:
- Lists have varying lengths (4-6 numbers)
- Numbers include both even and odd integers
- Numbers range from small (3) to larger (116)
- Some consecutive numbers in lists appear to have relationships

2) Looking for patterns:
- In first list: 12→6→3 shows division by 2
                16→8→4 also shows division by 2
- In second list: 46→23 shows division by 2
- In third list: 14→7 shows division by 2
                 36→18 shows division by 2

3) Initial pattern hypothesis:
Each list contains sequences where numbers can be divided by 2 to get the next number in the sequence. However, lists can contain multiple such sequences, and not all adjacent numbers need to be related.

Let me test this with varied cases to try to falsify or refine this hypothesis.

Interesting results! Let me analyze:

1) [24, 12, 6, 3] - Valid ✓
   Shows a single descending sequence of division by 2

2) [8, 4, 2, 15, 30] - Invalid ✗
   Has descending sequence 8→4→2, but 15→30 goes up
   This suggests direction might matter

3) [100, 50, 25] - Valid ✓
   Another descending sequence

4) [64, 32, 7, 14] - Invalid ✗
   Has descending 64→32, but 7→14 goes up

5) [10, 5, 20, 10, 5] - Invalid ✗
   Has descending sequences but also ascending

Key insights:
1. Direction seems to matter - sequences must be descending (dividing by 2)
2. Multiple independent sequences appear to be allowed (from original examples)
3. Not every number needs to be part of a sequence
4. Ascending sequences (multiplying by 2) are not allowed

Let me test these refined insights.

Very interesting results! This is quite revealing:

1-3 & 5 were invalid, but 4 [16, 4, 2] was valid. Looking at this and previous results:

Key observations:
1. [16, 4, 2] is valid - notice this isn't just dividing by 2 each time, it's dividing by 4 then 2
2. Looking back at original examples with this lens:
   - [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] - has descending sequences with various ratios
   - [9, 46, 23, 116] - similar pattern
   - [14, 7, 36, 18] - same

NEW INSIGHT: The sequences don't have to be strictly dividing by 2! They just need to be descending sequences where later numbers divide evenly into earlier numbers!

Let me test this broader hypothesis.

<response>

Fascinating! Let me analyze this carefully:

Valid lists we've seen:
- [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]
- [9, 46, 23, 116]
- [14, 7, 36, 18]
- [24, 12, 6, 3]
- [100, 50, 25]
- [16, 4, 2]
- [16, 8, 2, 1]

Looking at the latest results, I notice that [16, 8, 2, 1] is valid but [12, 4, 6, 2] isn't.
Key difference: In the valid list, each number is strictly less than all previous numbers.

NEW INSIGHT: I think I see it! Each number must:
1. Be strictly less than all previous numbers in the list
2. Divide evenly into at least one previous number

This explains why [12, 4, 6, 2] fails - 6 is greater than 4.

Let me test this refined hypothesis.

Very interesting! Let's analyze deeper:

Valid lists we've seen:
- [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]
- [9, 46, 23, 116]
- [14, 7, 36, 18]
- [24, 12, 6, 3]
- [100, 50, 25]
- [16, 4, 2]
- [16, 8, 2, 1]
- [48, 24, 12, 6]

Wait... looking at [9, 46, 23, 116], this completely breaks my previous hypothesis! This list increases!

NEW INSIGHT: I need to look at this differently. Let me look at each number and its relationship to the next number:
- [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]: Each number is divided by 2 to get next in its sequence
- [9, 46, 23, 116]: 46/2=23, 116/2=58
- [14, 7, 36, 18]: 14/2=7, 36/2=18

AHA! I think I see it now: The list can be broken into sequences where each number, when divided by 2, gives the next number in its sequence. The sequences can be independent of each other.

Let me test this refined hypothesis.

Let me analyze carefully:

Valid lists we've seen:

- [9, 46, 23, 116]

- [48, 24, 12, 6]
- [40, 20, 10, 5]
- [16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

Looking at [8, 4, 12, 6] being invalid but [40, 20, 10, 5] being valid:
The valid lists all seem to contain complete sequences where each number divides by 2 to get the next, with no "breaks" in the sequence.

In [8, 4, 12, 6], we have 8→4 and 12→6, but 4 doesn't connect to 12.
In [40, 20, 10, 5], we have a complete sequence: 40→20→10→5

Looking at [64, 32, 16, 8] being valid but [32, 16, 8, 24, 12, 6] being invalid:
- Both have complete sequences
- The invalid one has overlapping numbers (16, 8 appear in two sequences)

NEW INSIGHT: Each number can only appear once in the list! And it must be part of a complete sequence where division by 2 gives the next number.
