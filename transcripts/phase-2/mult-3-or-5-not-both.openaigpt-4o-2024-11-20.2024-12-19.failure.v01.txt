Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[9, 25, 12, 10]
[25, 6, 21, 35, 9]
[12, 40, 27]



Turn number 1
### Thought Process:
1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The lists contain integers, and there doesn't seem to be an immediately obvious pattern like all numbers being even or odd.
   - The numbers vary in size, and there are no negative numbers or zero in the given lists.
   - The lists are of varying lengths, so the rule likely applies to the individual numbers rather than the structure of the list itself.

2. **Brainstorming Hypotheses**:
   - I need to consider properties of the numbers (e.g., divisibility, prime factors, arithmetic properties, etc.).
   - I also need to consider combinations of properties (e.g., sums of digits, relationships between numbers in the list, etc.).

3. **Initial Hypotheses**:
   - Hypothesis 1: The numbers are all composite (not prime).
   - Hypothesis 2: The numbers are all divisible by 3 or 5.
   - Hypothesis 3: The numbers are all greater than 5.
   - Hypothesis 4: The numbers are all either perfect squares or divisible by 3.
   - Hypothesis 5: The numbers are all either even or divisible by 3.
   - Hypothesis 6: The numbers are all either divisible by 3 or have a digit sum divisible by 3.

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - I will generate test cases that aim to falsify these hypotheses. For example:
     - Include numbers that are prime, not divisible by 3 or 5, or less than 5.
     - Include numbers that are not perfect squares or divisible by 3.
     - Include numbers that are neither even nor divisible by 3.
   - I will also include edge cases (e.g., small numbers, large numbers, etc.).
