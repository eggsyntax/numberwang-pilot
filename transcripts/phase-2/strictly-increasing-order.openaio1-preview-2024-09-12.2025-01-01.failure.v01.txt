Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[2, 5, 7, 14]
[11, 14, 20, 21]
[7, 16, 44]



Turn number 1

{
  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "Numbers whose English names contain the letter 'e'",
    "Numbers less than 50",
    "Numbers whose digit sums are 2, 5, or 7",
    "Numbers that are prime",
    "Numbers that are multiples of 7",
    "Numbers with an even number of letters in their English names"
  ],

5. Yes


Turn number 2
Based on the initial lists provided and the fact that all of my previous test cases were accepted, it seems that any list of integers satisfies the rule. However, to confirm this hypothesis, I need to test cases that might potentially violate the rule, such as lists containing zero, negative numbers, very large numbers, or even an empty list. If these are also accepted, I can be confident that the rule is that any list of integers is accepted.

  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "Any list of integers is accepted",
    "Only lists of positive integers are accepted",
    "Lists without negative numbers or zero are accepted",
    "Only lists with numbers less than 1000 are accepted",
    "Any list is accepted regardless of content",
    "There is no rule; all lists are accepted"
  ],

Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  List items must be in strictly increasing order
Model rule: Any list of integers is accepted
Final judgment: {'explanation': 'These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 requires that each number in the list must be strictly greater than the previous number (e.g., [1,3,7] would be valid but [1,3,3,7] or [1,3,2,7] would not). Rule 2 accepts any list of integers with no restrictions on order or uniqueness. For example, [3,1,4,1] would be accepted by Rule 2 but rejected by Rule 1.', 'judgment': False}
