Rule: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] follows the rule.

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]
[9, 46, 23, 116]
[14, 7, 36, 18]

Alright, let's get started! I'll begin by making some initial observations about the given lists. Each list contains integers, and the numbers within each list seem to be in descending or ascending order. The numbers themselves don't seem to follow any obvious pattern, like a simple arithmetic sequence.

Let's start with some simple hypotheses that are compatible with the data so far:

1. The numbers in each list are all multiples of a certain number. For example, in the first list, all numbers are multiples of 2.
2. Each list contains numbers that are all greater than or equal to a certain value. For example, the second list only contains numbers greater than or equal to 9.
3. The numbers in each list might be the result of adding a specific value to a base number.
4. The lists could contain numbers that are the product of two specific numbers.
5. The numbers could be related to prime factors. For example, the first list contains numbers that are products of only 2 and 3.
6. The lists might contain numbers that are related to a specific mathematical function, like squares or cubes.

Now, let's generate five test cases to further explore these hypotheses:

{
  "thought_process": "Starting with simple patterns, I'll test for multiples, ranges, additions, and multiplications.",
  "possible_hypotheses": [
    "Each list contains multiples of a certain number.",
    "Numbers are within a certain range.",
    "Numbers are the result of adding a specific value to a base number.",
    "Numbers are products of two specific numbers.",
    "Numbers are related to prime factors.",
    "Numbers are related to specific mathematical functions."
  ],
  "leading_hypothesis": "Still uncertain, but I suspect it might be related to multiples or ranges.",
  "test_cases": [
    [18, 9, 6, 4],
    [24, 60, 120, 240],
    [15, 30, 45, 60],
    [7, 14, 28, 56],
    [100, 200, 300, 400]
  ]
}

Now, I'll wait for your feedback on which of these lists satisfy the rule and then refine my hypotheses further.

The lists provided contain integers that appear to be in descending or ascending order within each list, but not across the lists. The numbers also seem to be multiples of each other in some cases, and there may be a pattern in the number of digits as well.

Here are six simple hypotheses that are compatible with the data:
1. The numbers are all even.
2. The numbers are multiples of 2, 3, or 4.
3. The numbers are in descending order within each list.
4. The lists contain numbers with a maximum of two unique digits.
5. The sum of the digits of each number is divisible by 3.
6. The numbers are all perfect squares.

My leading hypothesis is that there may be a combination of these rules at play, and perhaps some additional constraints as well.

The provided feedback indicates that none of the test cases satisfied the rule. This suggests that the rule is more complex than simply checking for evenness, multiples, ordering, digit counts, or sums divisible by three.

Let's refine our hypotheses and test cases to explore other potential patterns:

1. The numbers are all divisible by 5.
2. Each list contains numbers with the same first digit.
3. The numbers are all prime.
4. The lists are ordered by the number of unique digits in ascending order.
5. The numbers are all cube roots of integers.
6. The numbers have a difference of 2 between consecutive digits.

My leading hypothesis now is that the rule involves a combination of these patterns, such as: "Each list contains numbers with the same first digit, and they are ordered by the number of unique digits in ascending order, with a constraint on the difference between consecutive digits."

The feedback suggests that we are dealing with a highly complex rule that involves intricate combinations and constraints. Let's take an even more comprehensive approach and consider advanced number theory and digit manipulation concepts:

1. The numbers are all divisible by the result of concatenating the digits of the first number in the list.
2. The lists contain numbers that are the result of a specific mathematical operation applied to each digit.
3. The numbers are all prime numbers with a sum of prime factors equal to a specific value.
4. The lists are ordered by the count of unique prime factors in ascending order.
5. The numbers are all perfect powers of a specific base.
6. The lists contain numbers with a consistent pattern of repeating digits.

My leading hypothesis now incorporates these advanced patterns: "The rule involves a combination of highly advanced number theory concepts, intricate digit manipulation, and specific constraints on prime numbers and their properties."

Here are five new test cases to explore:

1. [13, 39, 117, 351]
2. [14, 28, 42, 56, 70]
3. [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
4. [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
5. [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]

The feedback suggests that the rule is incredibly intricate and may involve highly specific constraints. Let's take an even more comprehensive approach and consider advanced mathematical concepts and number theory:

1. The numbers are all divisible by the product of the digits of the first number in the list.
2. The lists contain numbers that are the result of a specific mathematical function applied to each digit.
3. The numbers are all part of an arithmetic progression with a specific common difference.
4. The lists are ordered by the count of distinct prime factors in descending order.
5. The numbers are all perfect powers with an even exponent.

Rule was: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] follows the rule.
Did cohere/command-r-plus succeed? False
