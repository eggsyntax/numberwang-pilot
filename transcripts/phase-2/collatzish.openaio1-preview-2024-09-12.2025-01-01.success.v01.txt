Rule: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4] follows the rule.

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]
[9, 46, 23, 116]
[14, 7, 36, 18]



Turn number 1
As an experienced scientist, I will begin by analyzing the given lists to identify patterns and formulate possible hypotheses.

**Analysis of the Given Lists:**

1. **List [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]:**
   - **Observations:**
     - 6 is half of 12.
     - 3 is half of 6.
     - 8 is half of 16.
     - 4 is half of 8.
     - There are consecutive halving sequences.
   - **Inference:** Contains multiple pairs where one number is half of another.

2. **List [9, 46, 23, 116]:**
   - **Observations:**
     - 23 is half of 46.
     - No direct halving relationship involving 9 and 116.
   - **Inference:** Contains at least one pair where one number is half of another.

3. **List [14, 7, 36, 18]:**
   - **Observations:**
     - 7 is half of 14.
     - 18 is half of 36.
   - **Inference:** Contains pairs where one number is half of another.

**Possible Hypotheses:**

Based on these observations, I will brainstorm multiple hypotheses:

1. The list must contain at least one pair of numbers where one is half of another.
2. The list must contain at least two pairs where one number is half of another.
3. The list must have consecutive numbers where each is half of the previous one.
4. All numbers in the list are even.
5. The list contains numbers where one is a multiple of another.
6. The list must contain numbers that can be paired as one number and its double.

**Leading Hypothesis:**

The most consistent pattern is that the lists contain pairs where one number is half of another. Therefore, my leading hypothesis is:

- **The list must contain at least one pair of numbers where one is half of another number in the list.**

**Test Cases to Evaluate the Hypotheses:**

To test and refine my hypotheses, I will generate new lists:

1. **Test Case 1:** [5, 10, 15]
   - Contains 5 and 10 (10 is double of 5).
2. **Test Case 2:** [7, 14, 28, 56]
   - Contains multiple pairs with halving relationships.
3. **Test Case 3:** [3, 5, 7]
   - Contains no pairs where one number is half of another.
4. **Test Case 4:** [18, 9, 27]
   - Contains 18 and 9 (9 is half of 18).
5. **Test Case 5:** [4, 8, 12, 16]
   - Contains multiple halving pairs.

Turn number 2
As an experienced scientist, I need to reconsider my hypotheses based on the new results. All my previous test cases were rejected, indicating that my initial hypothesis was incorrect.

**Re-analysis of the Given Lists:**

1. **List [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]:**
   - **Ratios of adjacent numbers:**
     - 12 / 6 = **2**
     - 6 / 3 = **2**
     - 3 / 16 ≈ **0.1875** (approximately **0.2**)
     - 16 / 8 = **2**
     - 8 / 4 = **2**

2. **List [9, 46, 23, 116]:**
   - **Ratios of adjacent numbers:**
     - 9 / 46 ≈ **0.1956** (approximately **0.2**)
     - 46 / 23 = **2**
     - 23 / 116 ≈ **0.1983** (approximately **0.2**)

3. **List [14, 7, 36, 18]:**
   - **Ratios of adjacent numbers:**
     - 14 / 7 = **2**
     - 7 / 36 ≈ **0.1944** (approximately **0.2**)
     - 36 / 18 = **2**

**Pattern Identified:**

- The ratios between adjacent numbers are consistently either **2** or approximately **0.2** (which is **1/5**).
- This suggests that the lists include pairs where the previous number is either double or one-fifth of the next number.

**Possible Hypotheses:**

1. The list must contain at least one pair of adjacent numbers where the previous number divided by the next equals **2**.
2. The list must contain at least one pair of adjacent numbers where the previous number divided by the next is approximately **0.2** (**1/5**).
3. The ratios of all adjacent numbers must be either **2** or approximately **0.2**.
4. The list must start with a ratio of **2** and alternate with a ratio of approximately **0.2**.
5. The list must contain both ratios of **2** and approximately **0.2** between adjacent numbers.
6. The list must have at least one instance where the previous number is one-fifth of the next number.

**Leading Hypothesis:**

- **The list must contain at least one pair of adjacent numbers where the ratio of the previous number divided by the next is approximately **0.2** (i.e., one-fifth).**

**Test Cases to Evaluate the Hypothesis:**

1. **Test Case 1:** [3, 15]
   - **Ratios:**
     - 3 / 15 = **0.2** (acceptable)
2. **Test Case 2:** [5, 25, 5]
   - **Ratios:**
     - 5 / 25 = **0.2** (acceptable)
     - 25 / 5 = **5** (not **2** or **0.2**)
3. **Test Case 3:** [8, 40, 8]
   - **Ratios:**
     - 8 / 40 = **0.2** (acceptable)
     - 40 / 8 = **5** (not **2** or **0.2**)
4. **Test Case 4:** [4, 20, 4]
   - **Ratios:**
     - 4 / 20 = **0.2** (acceptable)
     - 20 / 4 = **5** (not **2** or **0.2**)
5. **Test Case 5:** [7, 35, 7]
   - **Ratios:**
     - 7 / 35 = **0.2** (acceptable)
     - 35 / 7 = **5** (not **2** or **0.2**)

As an experienced scientist, I will revisit my analysis in light of the new information that none of my previous test cases satisfied the rule. This suggests that my initial hypotheses were incorrect. I need to look for a new pattern in the given lists.

**Re-analysis of the Given Lists:**

1. **List [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]:**

   - **Ratios between adjacent numbers:**
     - 6 / 12 = **0.5**
     - 3 / 6 = **0.5**

- The ratios between adjacent numbers alternate between approximately **0.5** and **5**.
- This pattern suggests that each number is either half or five times the previous number.

5. The list is generated by repeatedly multiplying the starting number by **0.5** and **5** alternately.
6. The list must have at least three numbers with ratios alternating between **0.5** and **5**.

As an experienced scientist, I will revisit the problem with a fresh perspective, considering the previous hypotheses have been invalidated.

**Re-analysis of the Given Lists:**

1. **List [12, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4]:**

   - **Step 1:** 12 is even, so next number is \(12 \div 2 = 6\).
   - **Step 2:** 6 is even, so next number is \(6 \div 2 = 3\).
   - **Step 3:** 3 is odd, so next number is \(5 \times 3 + 1 = 16\).
   - **Step 4:** 16 is even, so next number is \(16 \div 2 = 8\).
   - **Step 5:** 8 is even, so next number is \(8 \div 2 = 4\).

2. **List [9, 46, 23, 116]:**

   - **Step 1:** 9 is odd, so next number is \(5 \times 9 + 1 = 46\).
   - **Step 2:** 46 is even, so next number is \(46 \div 2 = 23\).
   - **Step 3:** 23 is odd, so next number is \(5 \times 23 + 1 = 116\).

3. **List [14, 7, 36, 18]:**

   - **Step 1:** 14 is even, so next number is \(14 \div 2 = 7\).
   - **Step 2:** 7 is odd, so next number is \(5 \times 7 + 1 = 36\).
   - **Step 3:** 36 is even, so next number is \(36 \div 2 = 18\).

**Pattern Identified:**

- Each list is generated by starting with a number and applying a specific rule:
  - **If the number is even, divide it by 2.**
  - **If the number is odd, multiply it by 5 and add 1.**

**Possible Hypotheses:**

1. The list is generated by starting from a number and applying the rule: If \(n\) is even, the next number is \(n \div 2\); if \(n\) is odd, the next number is \(5n + 1\).
2. The lists represent sequences where each subsequent number is determined by halving even numbers and applying \(5n + 1\) to odd numbers.
3. The sequence alternates between division by 2 and multiplication by 5 plus 1, based on the parity of the current number.
4. The rule generating the sequence involves operations that depend solely on whether the current number is even or odd.
5. The list is a variation of the Collatz conjecture, but with \(5n + 1\) instead of \(3n + 1\) for odd numbers.
6. The numbers in the list are generated by repeatedly applying these parity-based operations until a stopping condition is met.

**Final Hypothesis:**

- **The list is generated by starting from a number and applying the rule:**
  - **If the number is even, divide it by 2.**
  - **If the number is odd, multiply it by 5 and add 1.**

**Test Cases to Evaluate the Hypothesis:**
