Rule: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16] follows the rule.

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [
    <1st list of integers to test>,
    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16]
[4, 2, 1, 6, 3]
[14, 7, 36, 18]

Let's analyze the given lists:
List 1: [12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16]
List 2: [4, 2, 1, 6, 3]
List 3: [14, 7, 36, 18]

Initial observations:
* The lists contain positive integers.
* There doesn't seem to be a strict ascending or descending order.
* Some numbers appear to be related by division or multiplication by 2 (e.g., 12 and 6, 4 and 2, 36 and 18).

Let's explore some hypotheses:

1. The lists contain even and odd numbers.
2. The lists contain numbers divisible by 2, 3, or both.
3. The lists contain numbers that are multiples of some smaller number in the list.
4. The lists contain numbers related by division or multiplication by a small integer (like 2 or 3).
5. The lists contain numbers where at least one number is half of another number in the list.
6. The lists contain numbers where the sum of the digits is even.

Let's generate some test cases to explore these hypotheses:

All test cases were rejected. This disproves my leading hypothesis and several others.  It seems that simply having doubles, even/odd numbers, or multiples isn't sufficient.  The rule must be more specific.

Let's rethink. The original examples all had at least one pair where one number was double the other.  Perhaps the rule requires *more* than one such pair? Or perhaps a specific combination of doubling and other factors?  The rejection of [1, 2, 3, 4] suggests that simply having consecutive numbers isn't enough, even though it contains doubles.

New Hypotheses:
1. The list contains at least two pairs of numbers where one is double the other.
2. The list contains at least one number that is double another, and at least one number that is half another.
3. The list contains at least one number that is double another, and at least one odd number.

All negative again. This is valuable information.  It seems that even combining the doubling requirement with odd numbers, divisibility by 3, or sum constraints isn't sufficient.  The rule must be even more nuanced.

Let's consider the relationship between the doubled numbers.  Perhaps the rule involves a chain of doubles, or a specific arrangement of the doubled pairs. The fact that [2, 4, 1, 3] failed suggests that simply having a double and an odd number isn't enough.

New Hypotheses:
1. The list contains at least two distinct pairs where one is double the other (e.g., not [2, 4, 4, 8] where 4 is used twice).
2. The list contains a chain of at least three numbers where each is double the previous (e.g., 2, 4, 8).

Okay, this is getting tricky.  The rule is more complex than I initially anticipated. The failure of seemingly diverse test cases suggests that we need to consider more intricate relationships between the numbers.

Let's consider the prime factorization of the numbers. Perhaps the rule involves shared prime factors, or a specific combination of prime factors.  The fact that [2, 4, 3] failed suggests that simply having a double and a prime isn't enough.  Also, [3, 6, 12, 10] failing suggests that having doubles and numbers with different prime factors isn't enough either.

New Hypotheses:
1. The list contains at least one double, and at least one number with a prime factor greater than 3.
2. The list contains at least one double, and the numbers have at least three distinct prime factors in total.
3. The list contains at least one double, and at least one number that is not divisible by any other number in the list (besides 1).
4. The list contains at least one double, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all numbers is 1.
5. The list contains at least one double, and the least common multiple (LCM) of all numbers is greater than the largest number in the list.
6. The list contains at least one double, and the product of all numbers is not a perfect square.

All right, the pattern is proving quite elusive. The GCD hypothesis and related ideas didn't pan out.  Let's revisit the original lists and look for other subtle relationships.

Original lists:
[12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16] - Doubles: (6,12), (5,10)  Other factors: 3, 16
[4, 2, 1, 6, 3] - Doubles: (2,4), (1,2?) Other factors: 3, 6
[14, 7, 36, 18] - Doubles: (7,14), (18,36)

Notice that in each list, there's at least one double *and* another number that is not related to any other number by doubling.  This seems promising.

New Hypotheses:
1. The list contains at least one double, and at least one number that is not a power of 2 times any other number in the list.
2. The list contains at least one double, and at least one number that is relatively prime to all other numbers in the list.
3. The list contains at least one double, and at least one number that has a unique prime factor (a prime factor not present in any other number in the list).
4. The list contains at least one double where the smaller number is odd, and at least one even number.
5. The list contains at least one double where the smaller number is even, and at least one odd number.
6. The list contains at least two doubles formed by different numbers (e.g., (2,4) and (5,10), but not (2,4) and (4,8)).

Let's analyze why the latest tests failed.  The hypothesis about unique prime factors seemed promising, but it's clearly not the complete rule.  Perhaps the "unique prime factor" needs to be present in a number that is *not* part of a doubling relationship.

1. The list contains at least one double, and at least one number that is not part of *any* doubling relationship within the list and has a unique prime factor.
2. The list contains at least one double, and at least one number that is not a power of two times any other number in the list, and this number has a unique prime factor.

Let's refine the hypothesis further. The unique prime factor idea is close, but the issue might be with how we define "part of a doubling relationship."  Perhaps a number can be involved in a doubling relationship *indirectly*. For example, in [2, 4, 6], 6 is related to 2 through multiplication by 3, and 2 is related to 4 through doubling.

The persistent rejections suggest a fundamental flaw in the approach.  Let's reconsider the "not a power-of-two multiple" constraint. Perhaps it's too restrictive.  Maybe the rule allows for some numbers to be power-of-two multiples, as long as there's at least one number that isn't.

The failure of these simpler hypotheses is very informative. It strongly suggests that the rule involves a specific combination of a double and some other property, but not as simple as just being greater than 2, odd, or divisible by 3.

Let's focus on the relationship between the double and the other numbers.  Perhaps the "other number" needs to be related to the double in a specific way, but not be a power-of-two multiple.

New Hypotheses:

The failure of these simpler hypotheses is very informative. It strongly suggests that the rule involves a specific combination of a double and some other property, but not as simple as just being greater than 2, odd, or divisible by 3.

Let's focus on the relationship between the double and the other numbers.  Perhaps the "other number" needs to be related to the double in a specific way, but not be a power-of-two multiple.

New Hypotheses:

1. The list contains at least one double, and at least one number that is not a divisor or a multiple (including power-of-two multiples) of either number in the double.
2. The list contains at least one double, and at least one number that is a multiple of a prime number greater than 2.

The failure of these basic tests is truly perplexing.  It suggests that the rule is neither about simple properties like even/odd numbers, primes, or doubles, nor about complex relationships involving prime factorization or multiples.  

Let's consider a radical shift in perspective. Perhaps the rule isn't about numerical properties at all, but about the *structure* of the lists themselves.

New Hypotheses:

1. The list contains at least three distinct numbers.
2. The list contains at least one repeated number.
3. The list contains numbers that are not all consecutive.
4. The list has a length greater than 2.
5. The list contains at least one number that is the sum of two other numbers in the list.

The failure of the structural hypotheses is surprising.  It seems the rule is neither purely numerical nor purely structural.  Perhaps it's a combination of both.  Let's revisit the idea of doubles, but combine it with a structural constraint.

New Hypotheses:

1. The list contains at least one double, and the list has at least 3 elements.
2. The list contains at least one double, and the list contains at least two distinct numbers.
3. The list contains at least one double, and the list is not sorted in ascending or descending order.
4. The list contains at least one double formed by distinct elements (e.g., [2, 4] but not [2, 2, 4]), and the list has at least 3 elements.

The failure of these combined hypotheses suggests we need to rethink our fundamental assumptions.  Perhaps the "double" concept itself is misleading.  Let's consider ratios between numbers instead.

New Hypotheses:

1. The list contains at least three elements, and the ratio between the largest and smallest numbers is greater than 2.
2. The list contains at least three elements, and there exist at least two numbers whose ratio is an integer greater than 1.
3. The list contains at least three elements, and there exist at least two numbers whose ratio is a power of 2.
4. The list contains at least three elements, and there exist at least two numbers whose ratio is 2.  (This is the "double" rule with a size constraint).

The failure of the ratio-based hypotheses, even with the size constraint, suggests we need to explore more complex relationships between the numbers.  Perhaps the rule involves combinations of ratios or other multiplicative relationships.

New Hypotheses:

2. The list contains at least three elements, and there exist two pairs of numbers (a, b) and (c, d) such that a/b = c/d and this ratio is not 1.
