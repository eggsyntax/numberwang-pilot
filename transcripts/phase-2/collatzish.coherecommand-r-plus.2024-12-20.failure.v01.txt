Rule: If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16] follows the rule.

Initial prompt: 
Hello! You are an extremely intelligent and experienced scientist. I will present you with several lists, each containing several integers, each of which satisfies some rule. Your task is to create, test, and refine/replace hypotheses about the underlying rule that the list satisfies.

Explain your hypotheses, and then use them to generate five new lists to test them. I will then tell you which of your proposed lists satisfy the rule. Then you will refine or replace your hypotheses as needed and present me with five more lists you want to test. You can perform as many such tests as you wish, up to a maximum of 19 rounds. When you are confident that your hypothesis is correct, say so and give your final hypothesis.

* Look for patterns & relations. Look for the unexpected.
* Brainstorm multiple hypotheses, as different as possible. Think out of the box! Include six maximally simple hypothesis compatible with the data in each "possible_hypotheses" section (defined below).
* Do tests that falsify/distinguish between hypotheses. Avoid confirmation bias!
* Look for the broadest, simplest, most elegant hypothesis that explains the data.
* If stuck, try simple tests or variants on what worked before.
* Before settling on a final hypothesis, try removing constraints to see if they're necessary.

Think out loud step by step as much as you want, and then add a line with only a <response> tag, and then finish your response with exactly the following JSON format:

{
  "thought_process": <contains your current thinking about the task -- think out loud here as much as you want before continuing>,
  "possible_hypotheses": <list of six strings, each describing a possible hypothesis which is compatible with the data so far>,
  "leading_hypothesis": <string describing your current hypothesis>,
  "final_hypothesis": <a string describing your final hypothesis>,
  "test_cases": [

    <2nd list of integers to test>,
    <3rd list of integers to test>,
    <4th list of integers to test>,
    <5th list of integers to test>
  ]
}

If and only if you're fully confident that your latest hypothesis is correct, you should include the "final_hypothesis" key; otherwise you should always include the "leading_hypothesis" key.

Remember: good scientists think hard about ways to falsify their hypothesis!

Here are your example lists:
[12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16]
[4, 2, 1, 6, 3]
[14, 7, 36, 18]

Alright, let's get started! I'll begin by noting that all the numbers in the given lists are positive integers. Here are some initial observations:

- The numbers in each list are in sorted order.
- The differences between consecutive numbers in the first list are {6, 3, 5, 1}. These differences seem to be chosen "at random" from the set of positive integers less than 6.
- The differences between consecutive numbers in the second list are {2, 3, 3}. These differences seem to be chosen "at random" from the set of positive integers less than the minimum of 4 and 3.
- The differences between consecutive numbers in the third list are {7, 18}. These differences seem to be chosen "at random" from the set of positive integers less than the minimum of 14 and 7.

Based on these observations, a simple hypothesis is that each list is generated by starting with a positive integer and then repeatedly adding a positive integer that is less than the minimum of the current list.

Now, let's create some test cases to refine our hypothesis. I'll propose six simple hypotheses that are compatible with the data so far and then use them to generate five test cases each.

Possible Hypotheses:
1. Each list is generated by starting with a positive integer and then repeatedly adding 1.
2. Each list is generated by starting with a positive integer and then repeatedly adding a positive integer less than or equal to the current maximum.
3. Each list is generated by starting with a positive integer and then repeatedly adding a positive integer that is prime.
4. Each list is generated by starting with a positive integer and then repeatedly adding a positive integer that is a power of two.
5. Each list is generated by starting with a multiple of three and then repeatedly adding a multiple of three.
6. Each list ends with a number that is a multiple of its position in the list.

Leading Hypothesis:
Each list is generated by starting with a positive integer and then repeatedly adding a positive integer that is less than the minimum of the current list.

Test Cases:
1. [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]
2. [2, 4, 7, 11, 15]
3. [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21]
4. [5, 11, 17, 23, 29]

The feedback indicates that all five of my test cases were incorrect. This suggests that my leading hypothesis, which was based on the idea of adding positive integers less than the minimum of the current list, is incorrect.

Let's take a step back and consider other patterns in the data. One thing to note is that the differences between consecutive numbers seem to be "random" within certain constraints. For example, in the first list, the differences are {6, 3, 5, 1}, which could be interpreted as randomly chosen from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Another observation is that the maximum difference between consecutive numbers seems to decrease as the numbers in the list increase. For example, in the first list, the maximum difference is 6, in the second list, it's 3, and in the third list, it's 18.

Based on these observations, a new hypothesis could be that each list is generated by starting with a positive integer and then repeatedly adding a positive integer that is less than or equal to a certain maximum, which decreases as the numbers in the list increase.

Let's create some test cases to explore this hypothesis further:

The feedback suggests that my hypothesis about adding numbers less than or equal to a decreasing maximum value is incorrect. Let's take a closer look at the data and try to identify other patterns.

One thing I notice is that the differences between consecutive numbers seem to be related to the position of the numbers in the list. For example, in the first list, the differences are {6, 3, 5, 1}, which could be interpreted as {2*3, 1*3, 1*5, 1}. The multiplier seems to decrease as the position in the list increases.

Another observation is that the numbers themselves seem to be related to the position in the list. For example, in the first list, the numbers are {2*6, 1*6, 2*5, 1*4, 3*4, 4*4}. The multiplier seems to be related to the position in the list, and it's not always decreasing.

Based on these observations, a new hypothesis could be that each list is generated by multiplying the position in the list by a certain factor, and then adding or subtracting a small number to get the final value.

Let's create some test cases to explore this hypothesis:

Each list is generated by multiplying the position in the list by a certain factor and then adding or subtracting a small number.

The feedback suggests that my hypothesis about multiplying the position in the list by a factor and adjusting by a small number is incorrect. Let's take an even more fundamental step back and consider the simplest patterns that could be at play here.

One thing I notice is that the numbers in each list seem to be related to the position in the list. For example, in the first list, the numbers are {2*6, 1*6, 2*5, 1*4, 3*4, 4*4}. The multiplier seems to be related to the position, but it's not simply the position itself.

Another observation is that the numbers seem to be generated by some function of the position. For example, in the first list, the numbers could be generated by the function f(x) = (x + 1)x. This function seems to generate the numbers in the first list when applied to the positions 1 through 6.

Based on these observations, a new hypothesis could be that each list is generated by applying a function to the positions in the list.

The feedback suggests that my hypothesis about applying a function to the positions is incorrect. Let's consider other patterns that could be at play here.

One thing I notice is that the numbers in each list seem to have a certain "structure" to them. For example, in the first list, the numbers {12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16} can be thought of as {2^2 * 3, 2 * 3, 3, 2 * 5, 5, 2^4}. They seem to be related to prime factorizations, but in a non-trivial way.

Another observation is that the numbers seem to be generated by combining smaller numbers in some way. For example, in the first list, we can think of 12 as 6 + 6, 6 as 3 + 3, 3 as 5 - 2, and so on. There seems to be a combination of addition and subtraction involved.

Based on these observations, a new hypothesis could be that each list is generated by combining smaller numbers through addition and subtraction in a way that respects their prime factorizations.

The feedback suggests that my hypothesis about combining smaller numbers through addition and subtraction while respecting prime factorizations is incorrect. Let's take a step back and consider other patterns that could be at play here.

One thing I notice is that the numbers in each list seem to have a certain "pattern" or "rule" that generates them. For example, in the first list, the numbers {12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16} can be generated by the rule "start with 12, then divide by 2, then subtract 1, then add 5, then multiply by 2, then subtract 1". This rule seems to be specific to the first list and doesn't generalize to the others.

Another observation is that the numbers seem to be generated by a sequence of operations that involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, in the first list, we can think of 10 as 6 + 4, 5 as 6 - 1, 16 as 2 * 8, and so on. There seems to be a combination of these basic operations involved.

Based on these observations, a new hypothesis could be that each list is generated by applying a unique sequence of basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to a starting number.

The feedback suggests that my hypothesis about applying a unique sequence of operations involving a mix of arithmetic, advanced math, and list-dependent/external values is incorrect. At this point, we've explored a wide range of hypotheses, and none of them seem to fit the data perfectly. This suggests that the rule generating these lists could be quite complex and intricate.

Let's take a step back and consider the patterns we've observed so far:

- The numbers in each list seem to have a certain "pattern" or "rule" that generates them, and this rule seems to involve a combination of basic arithmetic operations and more advanced mathematical concepts.
- The numbers seem to be generated by a sequence of operations that involve not only the previous numbers in the list but also external values.
- The maximum difference between consecutive numbers seems to decrease as the numbers in the list increase.
- The numbers themselves seem to be related to the position in the list, but not in a simple linear way.

Based on these observations, a new hypothesis could be that each list is generated by a combination of multiple rules or patterns that involve advanced mathematical operations, external values, and unique sequences of operations.

Let's create some test cases to explore this hypothesis:

Leading Hypothesis:
Each list is generated by a combination of multiple rules or patterns that involve advanced mathematical operations, external values, and unique sequences of operations.

Test Cases:
1. [2, 6, 14, 24, 40, 60]
2. [3, 9, 21, 39, 63, 99]
3. [5, 25, 45, 65, 85, 105]
4. [2, 4, 8, 14, 16, 26]
5. [1, 3, 9, 15, 25, 36]

The feedback suggests that my hypothesis about combining multiple rules or patterns involving advanced math, external values, and unique sequences is incorrect. At this point, we've explored a wide range of hypotheses, and none of them seem to perfectly fit the data. This suggests that the rule generating these lists is extremely complex and may involve a high degree of randomness or unpredictability.

Let's take a step back and consider the patterns we've observed so far:

- The numbers in each list seem to have a certain "pattern" or "rule" that generates them, but this rule seems to be unique for each list and involves a combination of basic arithmetic operations, advanced mathematical concepts, and external values.
- The numbers seem to be generated by a sequence of operations that involve not only the previous numbers in the list but also external values, and these operations can be quite intricate.
- The maximum difference between consecutive numbers seems to decrease as the numbers in the list increase, but this pattern doesn't always hold true.
- The numbers themselves seem to be related to the position in the list, but this relationship is not consistent or straightforward.

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule generating these lists is highly complex and may involve a significant degree of randomness or unpredictability. It's possible that there is no simple pattern or rule that can perfectly describe the generation of these lists.

Final Hypothesis:
The lists are generated by a highly complex and unpredictable rule that involves a combination of advanced mathematical operations, external values, unique sequences, and possibly randomness.

Requesting final judgment.
Real rule:  If a list item n is even, the next item must be (n / 2). Otherwise (ie if n is odd), the next item must be (5 * n + 1). For example, [12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16] follows the rule.
Model rule: The lists are generated by a highly complex and unpredictable rule that involves a combination of advanced mathematical operations, external values, unique sequences, and possibly randomness.
Final judgment: {'explanation': 'These rules are not equivalent. Rule 1 is a specific, deterministic mathematical sequence known as the Collatz sequence generator, where each number determines the next through clear arithmetic operations. Rule 2 is vague and non-deterministic, allowing for randomness and external values. Given any list position and value, Rule 1 precisely defines what the next value must be, while Rule 2 could potentially allow any value to follow any other value. For example, Rule 1 requires that 12 must be followed by 6, while Rule 2 places no such constraint.', 'judgment': False}
